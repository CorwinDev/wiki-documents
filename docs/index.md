It's the third week of October and we are back with "Seeed Weekly Wiki Updates" as promised. This week was also filled with a lot of fun stuff at Seeed and we are happy to update you all with what we have done at Seeed Wiki. 
As you all know, Seeed Wiki is a dedicated platform where we provide the proper guidance and support you need when getting started with our products. We put a lot of effort to make this platform more user friendly because we want to enable the learning of electronics in a more systematic approach.  
We will bring you all these wiki updates in a weekly basis. So stay tuned with us and don't forget to visit this page again next week!

## Existing Wiki Updated

### RTC Usage on 2-Channel CAN-BUS(FD) Shield for Raspberry Pi 

We have added the RTC usage on the [2-Channel CAN-BUS(FD) Shield for Raspberry Pi](https://www.seeedstudio.com/2-Channel-CAN-BUS-FD-Shield-for-Raspberry-Pi-p-4072.html). Now you can use this shield along with a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Raspberry-Pi-4-Computer-Model-B-4GB-p-4077.html) for your projects that need to keep track of the time (seconds, minutes, hours,), date, month, and year information! We have added the wiki [here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/2-Channel-CAN-BUS-FD-Shield-for-Raspberry-Pi/#built-in-rtc-usage).
