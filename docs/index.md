# Weekly Wiki
![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/IMAGES/21-April-Week-1.png)

It's the first week of April and we are back with "Seeed Weekly Wiki Updates" as promised. This week was also filled with a lot of fun stuff at Seeed and we are happy to update you all with what we have done at Seeed Wiki. 
As you all know, Seeed Wiki is a dedicated platform where we provide the proper guidance and support you need when getting started with our products. We put a lot of effort to make this platform more user friendly because we want to enable the learning of electronics in a more systematic approach.  
We will bring you all these wiki updates in a weekly basis. So stay tuned with us and don't forget to visit this page again next week!

## Existing Wiki Updated 

### BIOS and EC Firmware Update for ODYSSEY-X86J4105

We have updated the BIOS and EC firmware to fix bugs and enhance the performance of the [ODYSSEY - X86J4105](https://www.seeedstudio.com/tag/ODYSSEY-X86J4105.html). Update yours now!

- [Upgrade to Latest BIOS](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ODYSSEY-X86J4105-Installing-OS/#how-to-upgrade-the-bios)

### Develop With STM32Cube MCU Package for LoRa-E5

Recently, we released the [LoRa-E5](https://www.seeedstudio.com/LoRa-E5-Wireless-Module-p-4745.html), the world's first combo of LoRa RF and MCU chip. It is a low cost, ultra-low power high performance LoRaWAN module that is smaller than most coins! Our new development kits make it easier for everybody to build prototypes with the support of LoRa technology.

We have now prepared getting started guides, aiming at creating a LoRaWAN End Node with STM32Cube MCU Package for STM32WL series(SDK), to join and send data to LoRaWAN Network.

### Wio Terminal Bluetooth Libraries on Arduino Library Manager

Recently we added all the [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html) [WiFi libraries](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Network-Overview/) to Arduino library Manager.

This time, we have added the bluetooth libraries as well. Now you can easily install all the wireless libraries for Wio Terminal! Follow [this guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Bluetooth-Overview/) to learn more!

## New Wiki Added

### Grove - Oxygen Sensor Pro(GGC2330-O2)

[Grove - Oxygen Sensor Pro(GGC2330-O2)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Oxygen-Sensor-Pro-Pre-calibration-p-4896.html) is a kind of sensor to test the oxygen concentration in air, which is based on the principle of the electrochemical cell to the original work.When it starts to work, it will produce a current proportional to the concentration of oxygen, then you can determine the concentration of oxygen by measuring the size of the current.
We have prepared a [step-by-step guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Oxygen-Sensor-Pro/) for you to experiment with this sensor!

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Oxygen-Sensor-Pro/"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_Oxygen_Sensor_Pro/img/IMG_9621.png" alt="pir"  width="600" height="auto"></a></p>

### LoRaWAN Gateway Module WM1302

[WM1302 module](https://www.seeedstudio.com/WM1302-LoRaWAN-Gateway-Module-SPI-EU868-p-4889.html) is a new generation of LoRaWAN gateway module with mini-PCIe form-factor. Based on the Semtech® SX1302 baseband LoRaWAN® chip, WM1302 unlocks the greater potential capacity of long-range wireless transmission for gateway products. It features higher sensitivity, less power consumption, and lower operating temperature than the previous SX1301 and SX1308 LoRa® chip.
