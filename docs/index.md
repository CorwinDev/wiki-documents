It's the first week of June and we are back with "Seeed Weekly Wiki Updates" as promised. This week was also filled with a lot of fun stuff at Seeed and we are happy to update you all with what we have done at Seeed Wiki. 
As you all know, Seeed Wiki is a dedicated platform where we provide the proper guidance and support you need when getting started with our products. We put a lot of effort to make this platform more user friendly because we want to enable the learning of electronics in a more systematic approach.  
We will bring you all these wiki updates in a weekly basis. So stay tuned with us and don't forget to visit this page again next week!

## New Wiki Added

### Getting Started with reTerminal

Introducing reTerminal, a new member of our reThings family. This future-ready Human-Machine Interface (HMI) device can easily and efficiently work with IoT and cloud systems to unlock endless scenarios at the edge.

reTerminal is powered by a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4) which is a Quad-Core Cortex-A72 CPU running at 1.5GHz and a 5-inch IPS capacitive multi-touch screen with a resolution of 1280 x 720. It has sufficient amount of RAM (4GB) to perform multitasking and also has sufficient amount of eMMC storage (32GB) to install an operating system, enabling fast boot up times and smooth overall experience. It has wireless connectivity with dual-band 2.4GHz/5GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0 BLE.

So far we have prepared two wiki documents for reTerminal and more will be cominmg along the way!

## What's More?

### Seeed on YouTube

With the help of TinyML technology, simple sensors become smart. We can now teach accelerometers to recognize various actions. Accelerate solution development by paring ready-to-use certified [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html) with Azure IoT Central.

IoT Plug and Play enables developers to integrate smart devices into solutions without complex manual configuration, reducing the barrier for beginner developers and saving the overall timeline of the project building.
