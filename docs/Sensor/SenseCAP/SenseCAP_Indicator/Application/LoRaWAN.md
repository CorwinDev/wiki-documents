## Hands-On Demo

In this section, we'll delve into the SenseCAP Indicator's basic LoRaWAN(*Class C* & *OTAA*) functionality through a practical demonstration. The process is divided into three main steps:

1. [Obtain Firmware](#flash_firmware): Customize and install the firmware as needed.
2. [Registering the Device](#HEAD_register_device): Add your device to a LoRaWAN Network Server.
3. [Configuring LoRaWAN Credentials](#configure_credentials): Enter necessary network details on your SenseCAP Indicator.

Before we begin, let's get some background on LoRaWAN.

## LoRaWAN

LoRaWAN is described as a Low Power, Wide Area (LPWA) networking protocol that wirelessly connects battery-operated devices to the internet across large regions or networks. It's a part of the LoRa wireless system and operates in a license-free spectrum, supporting long-range communication with limited bandwidth. It is characterized by long-range communication (up to 10 miles), long battery life (up to 10 years), low cost, and low power usage with a payload size ranging from 51 to 241 bytes depending on the data[^1].

:::info Interested in custom firmware?
The [ESP-IDF Programming Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v5.1/esp32/get-started/index.html#ide)(v5.1) provides insights on building your own. You can access and modify the [source code](https://github.com/Seeed-Solution/SenseCAP_Indicator_ESP32) to suit your specific needs.
:::



### 1.2 Flash Firmware:

To flash the firmware onto the SenseCAP Indicator, download it first and then use esptool (or `esptool.py` if you have an ESP-IDF environment) to flash it(for comprehensive guidance, refer to the [instructions](/SenseCAP_Indicator_Application_LoRaWAN)).

**Flashing firmware on Windows using esptool:**

Use the command below in the Windows command prompt to flash the firmware:

```jsx
<tool_path>/esptool.exe --chip esp32s3 --baud 921600 write_flash -z 0x0 <firmware_path>/indicator_lorawan.bin 
```

For example, if your `flash_bin` folder is located in drive `D:` and contains the following structure:

```sh
flash_bin/
├── esptool.exe
└── indicator_lorawan.bin
```

Your command will look like this:

```sh
./esptool.exe --chip esp32s3 --baud 921600 write_flash -z 0x0 ./indicator_lorawan.bin
```

<div align="center">
  <img class='border-radius: 10px;' width={680} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_Indicator/LoRaWAN_Application/esptool_nonport_flash.png.png"/>
</div>

If you have multiple ports and need to specify one, use the `-p` or `--port` argument:

```sh
./esptool.exe --chip esp32s3 -p COM20 --baud 921600 write_flash -z 0x0 ./indicator_lorawan.bin
```

<div align="center">
  <img class='border-radius: 10px;' width={680} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_Indicator/LoRaWAN_Application/esptool_port_flash.png"/>
</div>

:::note
Mac users should replace `./esptool.exe` with `./esptool`.

If you encounter issues during flashing, consider reducing the **baud speed** or refer to [these troubleshooting steps](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1411463/dev-ttyusb0-file-disappears-from-dev-directory-while-using-device).
:::

Once the firmware is successfully flashed, retrieve essential parameters like the Device EUI and APPkey from the LoRaWAN Network Server from the subsequent steps.

## 2. Register the Device on LoRaWAN Network Server {#HEAD_register_device}

> Before starting, ensure your device is within a LoRaWAN network's coverage area.

This section will guide you through connecting to a local LoRaWAN network server. We will use the [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/) platform as an example, alongside the [SenseCAP M2 Multi-Platform LoRaWAN Indoor Gateway (EU868)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-Multi-Platform-LoRaWAN-Indoor-Gateway-SX1302-EU868-p-5471.html). *If you are employing a different network server, the procedure will be similar*; you'll need to collect the essential information for activation:

- OTAA (Over The Air Activation):

- **Password:** `admin`

For further details and advanced configuration options, visit the [SenseCAP M2 Gateway LNS Configuration Guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Network/SenseCAP_Network/SenseCAP_M2_Multi_Platform/SenseCAP_M2_MP_Gateway_LNS_Configuration/).


### 2.2 Configure the Local Network Server (ChirpStack)
Refer to the ChirpStack documentation for detailed features and LoRaWAN version support: [ChirpStack Network Server Documentation](https://www.chirpstack.io/network-server/features/lorawan-versions/).

Here are the steps to configure your local network server using ChirpStack:

1. **[Create a Device Profile](#create_dev_profile):**  This standardizes the settings and capabilities of your devices. It's crucial for ensuring that your devices communicate effectively within the network.
2. **[Add an Application](#add_appication):** This helps organize and manage your devices. Applications are used to group devices that share the same purpose or characteristics, making management more straightforward.
3. **[Register a device under an application](#register_device):** This step links your device to the specific settings and data handling rules you've established in your application. It's a critical step to make sure your device operates correctly within your network.

#### 2.2.1 Create a Device Profile {#create_dev_profile}

To create a new device profile in `Device profiles`, go to 'Tenant' in the sidebar and then select 'Device profiles'.

<div align="center">
  <img class='border-radius: 10px;' width={220} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_Indicator/LoRaWAN_Application/sidebar_device_profile.png"/>
</div>

Creating a device profile is a crucial step in ensuring your device effectively communicates over the LoRaWAN network. This involves selecting technical parameters that influence the device's performance and compatibility. Here's how you can set it up:

- **MAC Version:** This refers to the version of the Media Access Control (MAC) protocol your device utilizes. The MAC protocol is essential for managing how your device accesses the network. You can select between versions v1.0.4 and v1.1.0.
- **Regional Parameters Revision:** These are the specific parameters that need to be configured based on the geographical location of your device. They ensure that the device complies with local regulations and network specifications.

**Choosing MAC Version**

The MAC version you select is pivotal as it determines the set of credentials your device will require:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='MAC Version 1.0.4'>

  You'll need the following credentials:

  - **DevEUI:** This is a unique identifier assigned to your device, ensuring global uniqueness.
  - **AppKey:** A secret key used for encrypting and securing your device's communications.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='MAC Version 1.1.0'>

  Your device will require these credentials:

  - **DevEUI:** A globally unique identifier for your device.
  - **AppEUI/JoinEUI:** A unique identifier for the application your device connects to.
  - **AppKey:** The cryptographic key used for securing communications.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


**Choosing Regional Parameters Revision**

In the context of setting up a device profile for the LoRaWAN network, the Regional Parameters (RP) version you choose is crucial for ensuring your device operates in compliance with specific regional standards and specifications.



**Current Setup**

For now, we are setting up a device profile with MAC Version `1.0.4` and Regional Parameters Revision `RP002-1.0.2`.

:::info Regional Parameters Revision
For configuring a device profile on the LoRaWAN network, `RP002-1.0.2` is a suitable choice for current needs. `RP002-1.0.3` is recommended by the [code](https://github.com/Lora-net/LoRaMac-node/blob/v4.7.0/src/mac/region/Region.h) as per the `v4.7.0` LoRaMac-node specification.

</div>


**Decoder Function**

Indeed, to make the payload data transmitted by your device meaningful and interpretable, it's essential to implement a decoder within the device profile. This decoder will translate the raw binary data into a readable format, allowing you to understand and utilize the information your device sends effectively.

<details>

<summary>Click to copy Decoder.js</summary>

The docoder is from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Seeed-Solution/SenseCAP_Indicator_ESP32/blob/main/examples/indicator_lorawan/docs/ChirpStackV4_Decoder.js)

```js
function decodeUplink(input) {
    var decoded = {
        data:[]
    };
    var type;
    var floatNumber;

    if ( (input.bytes.length  % 5) !== 0) {
        decoded.data.push({
            type: "error",
            Value: -1
        });

        return { data: decoded }
    }

    const arrayBuffer = new ArrayBuffer(4);
    const dataView = new DataView(arrayBuffer);
    
    for(let j =0 ; j < input.bytes.length; j+=5) {
        var num =0;
        switch ( input.bytes[j]) {
            case 0:
                type = 'Temp';
                num  = 2;
                break;
            case 1:
                type = 'Humidity';
                num  = 2;
                break;
            case 2:
                type = 'CO2';
                num  = 0;
                break;
            case 3:
                type = 'TVOC';
                num  = 0;
                break;
            case 4:
                type = 'Light';
                num  = 0;
                break;
            default:
                type = 'unknown';
                break;
        }
        for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            dataView.setUint8(i, input.bytes[j+i+1]);
        }
        floatNumber = dataView.getFloat32(0, true); 
        decoded.data.push({
            type:  type,
            Value: floatNumber.toFixed(num)
        });
    }
    return { data: decoded }
}

function encodeDownlink(input) {
  return {
    bytes: [225, 230, 255, 0]
  };
}
```

  <img class='border-radius: 10px;' width={680} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_Indicator/LoRaWAN_Application/ns_app_device_add.png"/>
</div>

To add a device, you need to specify a `Name` and provide a `Device EUI` along with the `Device Profile` you've previously created. 

You can opt to auto-generate the Device EUI or use an existing one from your device. 

For this process, we'll employ the auto-generated Device EUI. After submitting these details, the device will be added to the application, and you'll be automatically redirected to the OTAA Keys section.

<div align="center">
  <img class='border-radius: 10px;' width={680} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_Indicator/LoRaWAN_Application/ns_app_otaa.png"/>
</div>

Click the button to generate a random **Application Key (AppKey)** or opt to use a pre-existing one. Ensure you have all the necessary credentials and parameters. For *MAC Version 1.0.4*, the required credentials are:

- **DevEUI (Example):** `5d61e4648dc926e2`
- **AppKey (Example):** `ec2b966c2c4bbe94a6ef79d0479db0e5`

With these details, we have the command:

```sh
lorawan --eui 5d61e4648dc926e2 --app_key ec2b966c2c4bbe94a6ef79d0479db0e5
```

For additional commands and assistance, refer to the [console command](#commands) section.

## 3. Configure SenseCAP Indicator {#configure_credentials}

To establish a connection with your SenseCAP Indicator, you can use any **serial tool**([Minicom](https://wiki.emacinc.com/wiki/Getting_Started_With_Minicom), [Putty](https://www.putty.org/), etc.) or just use `idf monitor`(follow the detailed [instructions provided in the ESP-IDF documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.1.2/esp32/api-guides/tools/idf-monitor.html)):

<div align="center">
  <img class='border-radius: 10px;' width={680} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_Indicator/LoRaWAN_Application/esp_idf_monitor.png"/>
</div>

- `--eui=`: Sets the EUI (Extended Unique Identifier) for the device. It requires 8 hexadecimal digits, with MSB (Most Significant Bit) first.
  
- `--join_eui=`: Sets the JOIN EUI (formerly known as APP EUI) which is an application identifier in OTAA. It requires 8 hexadecimal digits, with MSB first.

- `--app_key=`: Sets the APP KEY, which is a cryptographic key used in the OTAA joining process. It requires 16 hexadecimal digits, with MSB first.

- `--dev_addr=`: Sets the Device Address for ABP. It's a 4 hexadecimal digit identifier, with MSB first.

- `--apps_key=`: Sets the APPS KEY for ABP, which is used for encrypting application payloads. It requires 16 hexadecimal digits, with MSB first.

- `--nwks_key=`: Sets the NWKS KEY for ABP, which is used for encrypting network payloads and for device authentication. It requires 16 hexadecimal digits, with MSB first.

## FAQs

<details>

<summary>1. Why is the True Network Server not sending a joinAccept?</summary>

**Note:** There are a few scenarios where a device may fail to receive a `joinAccept` from the network server:

- **Frequency Change:** If you alter the frequency settings but retain the same device credentials on the network server, the device may not synchronize properly.

- **Device Flash Cleaned:** If you've cleared the device's flash memory but continue using the same credentials, this can lead to synchronization issues.

In both cases, it's crucial to ensure that the OTAA (Over-the-Air Activation) device nonces (number used once) are in sync. To address this, use the `Flush OTAA device nonces` feature on your network server. This action will reset the nonces and help re-establish a proper connection.
