We put a lot of effort to make this platform more user friendly because we want to enable the learning of electronics in a more systematic approach.  
We will bring you all these wiki updates in a weekly basis. So stay tuned with us and don't forget to visit this page again next week!

## Existing Wiki Updated

### DAC Usage on Seeeduino XIAO

We have newly added the [DAC (Digital-to-analog converter) usage](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/#analog-input-and-output) on the [Seeeduino XIAO](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO-Arduino-Microcontroller-SAMD21-Cortex-M0+-p-4426.html).
It can produce an analog voltage between 0 and 3.3V. Also, it can be used to produce audio with more natural sound, or as a kind of "digital potentiometer" to control analog devices.
