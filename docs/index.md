It's the second week of August and we are back with "Seeed Weekly Wiki Updates" as promised. This week was also filled with a lot of fun stuff at Seeed and we are happy to update you all with what we have done at Seeed Wiki. 
As you all know, Seeed Wiki is a dedicated platform where we provide the proper guidance and support you need when getting started with our products. We put a lot of effort to make this platform more user friendly because we want to enable the learning of electronics in a more systematic approach.  
We will bring you all these wiki updates in a weekly basis. So stay tuned with us and don't forget to visit this page again next week!

## New Wiki Added

### Seeed OpenWrt on X86 and CM4 Boards

OpenWrt is an open-source Linux operating system which runs on embedded devices/ routers. It offers more features, performance and security than a traditional router. It has a filesystem thatâ€™s fully writable and includes a package management system. You can make use of these packages to suit your applications in various ways.

We have started developing our own OpenWrt firmware and prepared a [getting started guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/OpenWrt-Getting-Started) for the installation!

## Existing Wiki Updated

### TensorFlow Lite Demos on reTerminal

We have previously released a guide to get started with TensorFlow Lite on the [reTerminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/ReTerminal-with-CM4-p-4904.html).

Now it is possible to use TFLite Converter to convert any Tensorflow model into .tflite format, provided it only consists of operations supported by TFLite Runtime. We have tested a few demos and you can check them out [here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reTerminal_ML_TFLite/#examples)!
