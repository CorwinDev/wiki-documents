## Existing Wiki Updated 

### SenseCAP ONE Series Meteorological Sensors Wiki

[SenseCAP ONE](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAPONE-S700-7in1-Compact-Weather-Sensor.html) compact weather station consists of several meteorological sensors that measure the following parameters: air temperature & humidity, barometric pressure, light, precipitation, wind speed, wind direction, PM2.5, and PM10. By adopting a modular design, SenseCAP ONE makes it possible for you to conveniently integrate different combinations of sensors into one compact weather station according to actual application needs.

We have added a [demo](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-One-Series-Meteorological-Sensors/#demo) on how to create your very own weather station with the [SenseCAP ONE S700](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAPONE-S700-7in1-Compact-Weather-Sensor.html) and a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Raspberry-Pi-4-Computer-Model-B-4GB-p-4077.html)!
