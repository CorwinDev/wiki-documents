## New Wiki Added 

### Improve Readability of Your MicroPython Code with Pylint and Black

 When you write MicroPython codes for the Wio Terminal while using [ArduPy](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ArduPy/), it's better to follow some rules that are established for Python coding, so that the code can be made to look in the best quality possible. In this way, the code becomes better in readability as well. 
 We can use tools such as [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) and [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to easily improve your codes' readability to make it comply with the basic rules. We have prepared a [step-by-step guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Pylint-Black/) to explain about setting up Pylint and Black on your computer so that you can start linting and reformatting your codes right away!
