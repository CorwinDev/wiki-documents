![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/IMAGE/May%20Week%202/week-3-new.png)



Hello everyone! We hope everyone is staying safe from COVID-19 and wishing you all good health!
It's the third week of May and we are back with "Seeed Weekly Wiki Updates" as promised. This week was also filled with a lot of fun stuff at Seeed and we are happy to update you all with what we have done at Seeed Wiki. 
As you all know, Seeed Wiki is a dedicated platform where we provide the proper guidance and support you need when getting started with our products. We put a lot of effort to make this platform more user friendly because we want to enable the learning of electronics in a more systematic approach. 
We will bring you all these wiki updates in a weekly basis. So stay tuned with us and don't forget to visit this page again next week!

## New Wiki Added

### 1. Seeed Studio BeagleBone® Green Gateway

We are super excited to release the Seeed Studio BeagleBone® Green Gateway this week and we have prepared the [wiki page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/BeagleBone-Green-Gateway/) for it.
Seeed Studio BeagleBone® Green Gateway is a joint effort by BeagleBoard.org and Seeed Studio. Based on the open-source hardware design of BeagleBone® Black, the newest Seeed Studio BeagleBone® Green Gateway has added Ethernet connectivity to the previous design of Seeed Studio BeagleBone® Green Wireless, making it equipped with Wi-Fi + Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) + 10/100 Ethernet connectivities.

### 2. Grove - PH Sensor Kit (E-201C-Blue)

This week we are excited to release an all-new environmental sensor which is the Grove - PH Sensor Kit and we have prepared the [wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-PH-Sensor-kit/) page for it.

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-PH-Sensor-kit/"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/IMAGE/May%20Week%202/ph.png" alt="pir"  width="400" height="auto"></a></p>


This PH sensor measures the hydrogen-ion activity in water-based solutions. It is widely used in the chemical industry, pharmaceutical industry, dye industry, and scientific research where acidity and alkalinity testing is required. The driver board in this kit supports both 3.3V and 5V. With the standard BNC probe interface and the Grove connector, it is very convenient to use this sensor with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

You can experience an interesting experiment with this sensor in the video below.

### 3. Grove - ORP Sensor Kit (501Z)

We have also released another environmental sensor which is the Grove ORP Sensor kit and you can explore it's wiki [here.](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-ORP-Sensor-kit/)

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-ORP-Sensor-kit/"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/IMAGE/May%20Week%202/orp.png" alt="pir"  width="400" height="auto"></a></p>


An Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP) Sensor measures the activity of oxidizers and reducers in an aqueous solution. It measures the ability of a lake or river to cleanse itself or break down waste products. The Grove OPR sensor works with both 3.3V and 5V. The Grove connector and the BNC probe interface makes it easy to use and very suitable for Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects.




### 4. Grove - Doppler Radar (BGT24LTR11) - 24GHz Transceiver
We have newly added the Grove - Doppler Radar (BGT24LTR11) [wiki page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Doppler-Radar/).
The Grove – Doppler Radar is based on the BGT24LTR11 Silicon Germanium MMIC which is a 24GHz radar transceiver. It is driven by an XMC1302 MCU based on Arm® Cortex®-M0. This comes in a compact package and runs on very low power, providing high-precision measurements. You can easily use this to check whether an object is moving towards or away from the module using the onboard indicator LEDs.

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Doppler-Radar/"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/IMAGE/May%20Week%202/doppler%20combine.png" alt="pir"  width="900" height="auto"></a></p>


Check our Seeed Weekly Show - No.002 video to have an overview of this Grove - Doppler Radar (BGT24LTR11).

### 5. 2.7inch Triple-Color E-Ink Shield for Arduino

We have had the 2.7inch Triple-Color E-Ink Shield for Arduino and now we have prepared a [wiki page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/2.7inch-Triple-Color-E-Ink-Shield-for-Arduino/) for you to easily get started with this shield.
The 2.7inch Triple-Color E-Ink Display is an Arduino E-Ink display shield, which contains 264x176 pixels, and can display white/black/red for each pixel. This shield communicates with Arduino via the SPI interface and it reserves a Grove I2C interface for use with other modules. With the help of a comparison circuit, the module achieves self-adaption of the 3.3V and 5V voltage system.

## Existing Wiki Updated

### 1. ArduPy Support for Grove - Gas Sensor(MQ3)

Wih the introduction of ArduPy, we work hard to gradually bring you it's support to all the Grove Modules in the Grove Ecosystem. So in this week, we have added ArduPy support for our Grove - Gas Sensor(MQ3) and prepared a [tutorial](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Gas_Sensor-MQ3/) for you to get started with ArduPy using our Grove - Gas Sensor(MQ3), quickly and easily.

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Gas_Sensor-MQ3/"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Gas_Sensor-MQ3/img/WT-MQ3.png" alt="pir"  width="800" height="auto"></a></p>


### 2. ReSpeaker 2-Mics Pi HAT Support for ODYSSEY - STM32MP157C and NPi i.MX6ULL Dev Board

ReSpeaker 2-Mics Pi HAT, which is a dual-microphone expansion board, has been there on Bazaar for a while and, we have added this Pi HAT support to the newly released [ODYSSEY - STM32MP157C](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ODYSSEY-STM32MP157C/) and [NPi i.MX6ULL Dev Board](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/NPi-i.MX6ULL-Dev-Board-Linux-SBC/#iis). In this way, you will be able to easily realize voice recogniztion projects with the ODYSSEY - STM32MP157C and NPi i.MX6ULL Dev Board.

### 3. Seeeduino XIAO Getting Started Guide By Nanase
Seeeduino XIAO is the smallest Arduino compatible board in the Seeeduino Family. It is an Arduino microcontroller that is embedded with an Arm® Cortex®-M0+ (SAMD21G18). The interfaces of Seeeduino XIAO is rich for such a tiny development board.
We were really excited to see that one of our community members from Japan, whose name is Nanase has dedicated to prepare a getting started guide in Japanese which focuses on more content than our original getting started guide and we have translated that to English and have uploaded to our [wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO-by-Nanase/).

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO-by-Nanase/"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/IMAGE/May%20Week%202/Nanase.jpeg" alt="pir"  width="800" height="auto"></a></p>
We would like to thank Nanase for his hard work and support!

### 4. Seeed Light Sensor Selection Guide

We have released various types of light sensors during the past. Since there are so many to choose from, you may find it difficult to make a choice between them. So we have carefully prepared a [selection guide for light sensors](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Sensor_light/) to help you compare different parameters of different light sensors and make a better decision.

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Sensor_light/"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/IMAGE/May%20Week%202/light.png
