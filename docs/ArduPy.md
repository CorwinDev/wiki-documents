```

**Note:** You can also use `aip build -list` to check the available boards.

- To list installed ArduPy Libraries

```sh
aip list
```

- To flash ArduPy Firmware into hardware:

```sh
aip flash
```

!!!Note
        After commands, you use `-h` flags to see more usage for that command. For example, `aip flash -h`.

- To interact with the board (shell-based file explorer):

```sh
aip shell
```

**Note:** Once entered the ardupy-mpfshell, you can use `help` for more information and commands.

- Entering **REPL** mode:

```sh
aip shell -c "repl"
```

<div align=center><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Wio-Terminal/img/aip-shell.png"/></div>

- To run Python file:

```sh
aip shell -n -c "runfile <YourPythonFilePath> [Path]"
# Example Usage:
# aip shell -n -c "runfile /Users/ansonhe/Desktop/ur.py"
```

- To load files into the board using shell:

```sh
aip shell -n -c "put <YourPythonFilePath> [Path]"
# Example Usage:
# aip shell -n -c "put /Users/ansonhe/Desktop/ur.py"
```

### Running your First Script

Once flashed the ArduPy firmware, there should be a USB drive named **`ARDUPY`** appear in your PC. You can create the following Python files to get started.

- **`boot.py`**

To run a MicroPython script from boot up, simply name your project **`boot.py`** in the root location of the board. **This script is executed when the device boots up.**

- **`main.py`**

This is the default python script, but this does not run on boot up. The `main.py` runs when `main.py` has changes saved to it. i.e. it can auto reload.

### Usage under ardupy-mpfshell

Once entered ardupy-mpfshell, use `help` to check commands usage. Here listed some useful commands:

- To list files on the deivces:

```sh
ls
```

- To remove a file (or a directory) on the device:

```sh
rm <File/Directory>
```

- To upload e.g. the local file `boot.py` to the device:

```sh
put <YourPythonFilePath> [Path]
```

- To execute the files i.e. `test.py` on the device:

```sh
execfile test.py
```

## Using aip to include Other ArduPy Libraries Example

`aip` is one of the key feature of ArduPy, which can be used to convert Arduino Libraries to Python Interface to be used for ArduPy. Here we provide an example, how to include the ArduPy library into ArduPy Firmware using Wio Terminal:

1.Open Terminal/Powershell, run the following to install ardupy libraries.

```sh
aip install Seeed-Studio/seeed-ardupy-ultrasonic-sensor
```

2.Build the firmware:

```sh
aip build --board=wio_terminal
```

**Note:** Usage of flashing firmware will appeared at the bottom of build.

3.Flash the "**NEW**" firmware into the board **by copying the usage from end of build**. Here aip will automatically look for the board connected to the PC and upload the firmware. If board is not connected, an error will appear.

```sh
aip flash
```

<div align=center><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Wio-Terminal/img/aip-install-new.gif"/></div>

#### Library Example Usage

Once the library is included within the ArduPy firmware and flashed into the device, you can import and use the module as follow:

```sh
aip shell -n -c "put /Users/ansonhe/Desktop/ur.py"
```

>Replace `/Users/ansonhe/Desktop` to your path.

where the `ur.py` is:

```py
from arduino import grove_ultra_ranger
import time

ur = grove_ultra_ranger(0)

while True:
    print ("The distance to obstacles in front is:", ur.cm, 'centimeter')
    time.sleep(1)
```

For more reference, please check the [seeed-ardupy-ultrasonic-sensor](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/seeed-ardupy-ultrasonic-sensor).

## Time and Delay

- Importing time module and delaying:

```py
import time

time.sleep(1)           # Delay for 1 second
time.sleep_ms(500)      # Delay for 500 milliseconds
time.sleep_us(500)      # Delay for 500 microseconds
```

- Using time counter:

```py
import time

time.ticks_ms()          # milliseconds counter
start = time.ticks_us()  # microseconds counter
time.ticks_diff(time.tickus(), start) # Measure the difference between counters
```

**Note:** You can use the **`TAB`** key to auto-suggest and see all the functions available.For example, after typing `time.`, press **`TAB`** to sell all the functions in time.

For more reference, please visit [MicroPython time related functions](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/utime.html).

## Pin and GPIO

### Pinout Diagram for Seeeduino XIAO

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Seeeduino-XIAO/img/Seeeduino-XIAO-pinout.jpg)

### Pinout Diagram for Wio Terminal

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Wio-Terminal/img/WioT-Pinout.jpg)

To reference GPIO in ArduPy, simply use the physical pin map of the device that you are using. For example, for Wio Terminal, Pin 1 is 3.3V and Pin 2 is 5V.

- Importing Pin and configuring GPIO:

```py
from machine import Pin
p3 = Pin(3, Pin.OUT)    # Setting Pin 3 as a output pin
p3.on()                 # Setting Pin 3 to HIGH
p3.off()                # Setting Pin 3 to LOW

p3.value(1)             # Setting Pin 3 to HIGH using value method


p5 = Pin(5, Pin.IN)     # Setting Pin 5 as input pin
p5.value()              # Prints the value of the input pin

p3 = Pin(3, Pin.OUT, value=1) # Setting Pin 3 as HIGH in one line
p5 = Pin(5, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP) # Setting Pin 5 as input with pull-up resistors
```

## Map

To make it easier access to the Boards peripheralsï¼ŒArduPy has mapped the same calling methods from Arduino:

```py
from machine import Pin, Map
import time

LED = Pin(Map.LED_BUILTIN, Pin.OUT) # Setting builtin LED as output

while True:
    LED.on()
    time.sleep(1)
    LED.on()
    time.sleep(1)
```

## PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)

To use PWM, you must use the PWM channels on the device. Please refer this back to the device pin map, and indicate where the PWM channels are.

- Using PWM:

```py
from machine import Pin, PWM

pwm0 = PWM(Pin(13))     # Creating PWM Channel on Pin 13
pwm0.freq()             # Current frequency
pwm0.freq(1000)         # Sets the frequency to 1000Hz
pwm0.duty()             # Current duty cycle
pwm0.duty(200)          # Sets the duty cycle to 200
pwm0.deinit()           # Switch off PWM on the pin

pwm1 = PWM(Pin(16), freq=1000, duty=200) # PWM in one line
```

## ADC

To use ADC on the device, you must use the analog pins. For example, Pin 13(A0) on Wio Terminal.

**Note: ADC channel on Wio Terminal is 10 bit(0-1023).**

- Using ADC

```py
from machine import ADC, Pin

adc = ADC(Pin(13))      # Crating ADC on Pin 13
adc.read()              # reading ADC value, 0 ~ 1023
```

## DAC

To use DAC on the device, you must use the DAC pins or PWM pins on the board. For example, Pin 11(DAC0) on Wio Terminal.

**Note: DAC channel on Wio Terminal is 12 bit(0-4095).**

- Using DAC:

```py
from machine import DAC, Pin

dac0 = DAC(Pin(11))      # Creating DAC on Pin 11
dac0.write(512)          # Writing value to DAC, 512/4096*3.3 = 0.4125 V

dac1 = DAC(Pin(26), resolution=10)  # Creating DAC on Pin 26 and using 10 bit resolution
dac1.write(1023)                    # Writing max output to DAC, 3.3V
```

**Note:** When using DAC on PWM pins, the resolution on the channel will be only 8-bit.

```py
# Using DAC om PWM Pins
from machine import DAC, Pin

dac2 = DAC(Pin(16))     # Creating DAC on Pin 16
dac2.write(128)         # Writing value to DAC, 128/255*3.3 = 1.65V
```

## LCD

For Wio Terminal, the TFT LCD display can be used as followed. For more LCD reference, please visit [**ArduPy LCD API Reference**](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ArduPy-LCD/).


- Using the LCD module:

```py
from machine import LCD

lcd = LCD()                            # Initialize LCD and turn the backlight
lcd.fillScreen(lcd.color.BLACK)        # Fill the LCD screen with color black
lcd.setTextSize(2)                     # Setting font size to 2
lcd.setTextColor(lcd.color.GREEN)      # Setting test color to Green
lcd.drawString("Hello World!", 0, 0)   # Printing Hello World at (0, 0)
```

Note: Use **`tab`**  to see the available functions.
