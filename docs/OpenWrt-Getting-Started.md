### ODYSSEY - X86J4125/ X86J4105

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/OpenWrt/odyssey-ports-2.png" alt="pir" width="700" height="auto"></p>

The OpenWrt image has already included the necessary network configurations for the dual Gigabit ports to work out-of-the-box, so that you don't have to configure them by yourself. However, here is an explanation of how the 2 ports are configured. 

One port is configured as a **LAN interface** and the other as a **WAN interface**. The WAN interface is the one which can be connected to the internet and it is configured as a **DHCP client**. On the other hand, the LAN interface is the one which can be connected to the client devices and it is configured as a **DHCP server**. 

Here the LAN interface is configured so that it has a static IP address of **192.168.2.1**. However, if you connect this OpenWrt router to another router with default gateway IP of 192.168.2.1, you might want to change the IP address on the LAN interface or otherwise OpenWrt will have IP conflict. Please follow the **FAQ** below to learn more!
