## Existing Wiki Updated 

### mDNS Usage on WIo Terminal

The multicast DNS (mDNS) protocol resolves hostnames to IP addresses within small networks that do not include a local name server. Multicast DNS is designed for small networks and is intended to increase their user-friendliness. The idea is that users can connect devices in secret LANs without any issues.

We have prepared [an example](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Advanced-Wi-Fi/#mdns-usage) that sets up a mDNS web server on the [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html) so that other device connected in the same network can browse the webserver at a defined site.
