## Existing Wiki Updated

### Raspberry Pi support for Grove - Gas Sensor O₂(MIX8410)

We have had Arduino support for the [Grove - Gas Sensor O₂(MIX8410)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Oxygen-Sensor-MIX8410-p-4697.html), but however it was not supported by Raspberry Pi. Now we would like to bring it's support to [Raspberry Pi](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Raspberry-Pi-4-Computer-Model-B-8GB-p-4595.html) while using it with the [Grove Base Hat for Raspberry Pi](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Base-Hat-for-Raspberry-Pi-p-3186.html). You can click [here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Gas_Sensor-O2-MIX8410/#getting-started-with-raspberry-piwith-grove-base-hat-for-raspberry-pi) to get started!
