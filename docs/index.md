### Build an HMI Display for Raspberry Pi using Wio Terminal

With the release of [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html), we constantly bring you new features and updates to improve user experience. So this time you can turn your Wio Terminal into an HMI (Human Machine Interface) USB display for Raspberry Pi, Nvidia Jetson Nano, BeagleBone and even ODYSSEY - X86J4105! This makes it much more powerful and can be used in many industrial scenarios! 

It can support multiple Wio Terminals connected to the host device and we have prepared a [wiki page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-HMI/) to help you get started quickly and easily!
