# Bluetooth Overview

This wiki introduce how to update the Bluetooth firmware for the Wireless Core Realtek RTL8720 on Wio Terminal, as well as installing all the dependent libraries for Wio Terminal to enable BLE functionality.


## Update the Wireless Core Firmware(BLE)

In order to use the Bluetooth functionality, you must **update the Bluetooth firmware** to the Wireless Core to Wio Terminal.

### Tools and Set-ups

Same configuration as updating network firmware, Please follow [**this guide**](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Network-Overview/#update-the-wireless-core-firmware) for **tools and procedures**, but use the Bluetooth Firmware files below.

### Bluetooth Firmware Files

Download the Bluetooth Firmware Files from **[here](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/seeed-ambd-firmware/releases)**

!!!Note
        Bluetooth and WIFI can use the same firmware.

## Libraries Installations

- Update your **ArduinoSAMD Core** for Seeed's board to the latest verison: **â‰¥1.8.0**.
