### How to use Arduino Borads as DAPLink Device

**[Arm Mbed DAPLink](https://armmbed.github.io/DAPLink/)** is an open source software project that programs and debugs application software running on **Arm Cortex CPUs**. DAPLink is often referred to as interface firmware and runs on an auxiliary MCU connected to the SWD or JTAG port of the application MCU. This configuration is available on almost all development boards. It creates a bridge between your development computer and the CPU debug access port.

>Please also visit [DAPLink](https://github.com/ARMmbed/DAPLink) for more information.

Now, we have **developed the DAPLink firmware running on your Arduino Boards**(*SAMD Series*) such as [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html) and [Seeeduino Xiao](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO-Arduino-Microcontroller-SAMD21-Cortex-M0+-p-4426.html) so that you can upload and debug development boards that support DAPLink in a most cost-effective way! We have provided a [step-by-step guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Arduino-DAPLink) for you to easily use Arduino boards as DAPLink device!
