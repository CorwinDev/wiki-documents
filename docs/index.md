## New Wiki Added

### Connecting the Wio Terminal to Microsoft Azure IoT

Now you can connect your [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html) to [Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/)!
[@Benjamin Cab√©has](https://twitter.com/kartben) has written a [sample application](https://github.com/kartben/wioterminal-azureiothub-sample) to show how to connect your Wio Terminal to Azure IoT Hub. It is built on top of the [Azure SDK for Embedded C](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c), a small footprint, easy-to-port library for communicating with Azure services.
We would like to thank and appreciate Benjamin for the great work! Learn more [here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Azure-IOT/).
