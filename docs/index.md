# Wiki Weekly 
![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/IMAGE/logo-V4.png)

Hello everyone! We hope everyone is staying safe from COVID-19 and wishing you all good health!
It's the first week of May and we are back with "Seeed Weekly Wiki Updates" as promised. This week was also filled with a lot of fun stuff at Seeed and we are happy to update you all with what we have done at Seeed Wiki. 
As you all know, Seeed Wiki is a dedicated platform where we provide the proper guidance and support you need when getting started with our products. We put a lot of effort to make this platform more user friendly because we want to enable the learning of electronics in a more systematic approach. 
We will bring you all these wiki updates in a weekly basis. So stay tuned with us and don't forget to visit this page again next week!

## New Wiki Added

### 1. Grove - Digital PIR Motion Sensor(12m)
We have newly added the Grove - Digital PIR Motion Sensor(12m) [wiki page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Digital-PIR-Sensor/). Grove - Digital PIR Motion Sensor is a high-senstive, digital, infrared-based motion sensor which has a quick response time. What's special about this PIR motion sensor is that, it doesn't need additional Arduino libraries unlike many PIR motion sensors. It is also the cheapest PIR motion sensor in our PIR motion sensor family.

### 2. Coral-Mini-PCIe-Accelerator- x86

After the release of [ODYSSEY - X86J4105](https://www.seeedstudio.com/tag/ODYSSEY-X86J4105.html) Single Board Computer, we constantly focus on bringing you new tutorials and functions to help you realize more projects. This week we have prepared the [wiki page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Coral-Mini-PCIe-Accelerator-x86/) of Coral-Mini-PCIe-Accelerator which is fully supported by the ODYSSEY - X86J4105 Single Board Computer.

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Coral-Mini-PCIe-Accelerator-x86/"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/IMAGE/x86.jpg" alt="pir"  width="800" height="auto"></a></p>



This is a dual-key M.2 card with B+M keys, designed to fit any compatible M.2 slot. This form-factor enables easy integration into ARM and x86 platforms so you can add local ML acceleration to products such as embedded platforms, mini-PCs, and industrial gateways.




## Existing Wiki Updated

### 1. ArduPy-aip Usage 

We have released ArduPy last month and our community is already excited about it. 

ArduPy is a combination of Arduino and MicroPython. MicroPython uses the universal Arduino API to control the hardware so that it can be compatible with new platforms quickly. With the help of the aip package manager we provided, you can transform your favorite Arduino library into a MicroPython library. Through ArduPy, you can use Python to verify your ideas, learn python programming as well as micro-controller programming in a more efficient way.

We have worked very hard to bring you ArduPy along with properly organized tutorials to help you get started quickly and easily.
This week we have added more information about how to use arudpy-aip as a CLI tool and also have included more examples with more explanations of the APIs. Click [here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ArduPy/) to learn more about them.

### 2. ArduPy Support for Grove - Ultrasonic Distance Sensor

Wih the introduction of ArduPy, we work hard to gradually bring you it's support to all the Grove Modules in the Grove Ecosystem. So in this week, we have added ArduPy support for our Grove - Ultrasonic Distance Sensor and prepared a [tutorial](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Ultrasonic_Ranger/) for you to get started with ArduPy using our Wio Terminal, quickly and easily.

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Ultrasonic_Ranger/"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_Ultrasonic_Ranger/img/WT-ur.jpg" alt="pir"  width="800" height="auto"></a></p>


### 3. Displaying Coronavirus COVID-19 Live Data Using Wio Terminal

COVID-19 has become a major pandemic in the world and we decided to include a [tutorial](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Reading-COVID19/) for the Wio Terminal to display real-time COVID-19 statistics using the Coronavirus COVID19 API. Follow the tutorial, display the statistics and most importantly, stay safe!

### 4. Turning ON/OFF LCD Backlight On Wio Terminal

As you all know, we continuosly bring you new tutorials and new functions with our Wio Terminal and this week we have added the function of turning the Wio Terminal on and off. This can be useful in order to save some power in your projects. Click [here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-LCD-Basic/) to check this tutorial.

### 5. Added Micro-SD Card Formats Supported By Wio Terminal

It is very important to know the file system on the Micro-SD card before inserting it into the Wio Terminal. So, we have updated the list of MicroSD card formats which are supported by the Wio Terminal. Click [here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-FS-Overview/) to learn more.
### 6. Seeed Distance Sensors And Sound Sensors Selection Guides

We have released various types of distance sensors and sound sensors during the past. Since there are so many to choose from, you may find it difficult to make a choice between them. So we have carefully prepared selection guides for distance sensors and sound sensors to help you compare different parameters of different sensors and make a better decision.
