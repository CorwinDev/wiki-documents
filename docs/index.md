It's the first week of March and we are back with "Seeed Weekly Wiki Updates" as promised. This week was also filled with a lot of fun stuff at Seeed and we are happy to update you all with what we have done at Seeed Wiki. 
As you all know, Seeed Wiki is a dedicated platform where we provide the proper guidance and support you need when getting started with our products. We put a lot of effort to make this platform more user friendly because we want to enable the learning of electronics in a more systematic approach.  
We will bring you all these wiki updates in a weekly basis. So stay tuned with us and don't forget to visit this page again next week!

## Existing Wiki Updated 

### New Tool to Erase and Flash Firmware for RTL8720 on Wio Terminal

If you have been playing around with Wi-Fi on the [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html), you might have experienced that the process of erasing and flashing a new firmware was a bit lengthy. Now we have streamlined the process by reducing the steps using the new **ambd flash tool**. Now you can quickly flash new firmware to RTL8720!
Follow [this wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Network-Overview) to learn more!

### Connect Wio Terminal to Microsoft Azure IoT Central

Last week we released a wiki, explaining about how you can connect the Wio Terminal to [Microsoft Azure IoT Central](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-central). However, you were only able to run an already compiled code to get started quickly with Azure IoT Central.
Now you can easily add more sensors to the Wio Terminal and send telemetry data to Azure IoT Central while coding in **Microsoft Visual Studio Code**, along with **PlatformIO**. [Click here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Connect-Wio-Terminal-to-Microsoft-Azure-IoT-Central/#how-to-add-other-sensors) to jump straight into the tutorial!
