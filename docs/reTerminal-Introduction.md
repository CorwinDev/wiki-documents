# reTerminal - Introduction

 <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lakshanthad/Image/master/CM4_wiki/wiki_thumb.png" alt="pir" width="600" height="auto"></p>

Introducing reTerminal, a new member of our reThings family. This future-ready Human-Machine Interface (HMI) device can easily and efficiently work with IoT and cloud systems to unlock endless scenarios at the edge.

reTerminal is powered by a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4) which is a Quad-Core Cortex-A72 CPU running at 1.5GHz and a 5-inch IPS capacitive multi-touch screen with a resolution of 720 x 1280. It has sufficient amount of RAM (4GB) to perform multitasking and also has sufficient amount of eMMC storage (32GB) to install an operating system, enabling fast boot up times and smooth overall experience. It has wireless connectivity with dual-band 2.4GHz/5GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0 BLE. 

reTerminal consists of a high-speed expansion interface and rich I/O for more expandability. This device has security features such as a cryptographic co-processor with secure hardware-based key storage. It also has built-in modules such as an accelerometer, light sensor and an RTC (Real-Time Clock). reTerminal has a Gigabit Ethernet Port for faster network connections and also has dual USB 2.0 Type-A ports. The 40-pin Raspberry Pi compatible header on the reTerminal opens it for a wide range of IoT applications.

reTerminal is shipped with Raspberry Pi OS out-of-the-box. So, all you have to do is connect it to power and start building your IoT, HMI and Edge AI applications right away!

## Hardware Overview

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/ReTerminal/HW_overview.png" alt="pir" width="1000" height="auto"></p>

## Hardware and Interfaces Introduction

### 40-Pin Raspberry Pi Compatible Pins

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/ReTerminal/pinout_pic.png" alt="pir" width="1000" height="auto"></p>

The **40-pins** consist of **26 GPIO, up to 5 × I2C, up to 5 × SPI, up to 5 × UART, 1 x PCM, 1 x PWM, 1 × SDIO interface, 1 × DPI (Parallel RGB Display), up to 3× GPCLK outputs and 1 USB interface**.

The **USB interface** is extended from the internal **USB 2.0 interface** on the Compute Module 4. So you can expand to even more USB connectors and get speeds up to **480 Mbit/s** using this interface.

You can also use these 40 pins to connect to **Raspberry Pi compatible Hats** and expand your projects! For example the [Grove Base Hat](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Base-Hat-for-Raspberry-Pi.html) can be connected so that you can dive deep into the [Grove ecosystem](https://www.seeedstudio.com/category/Grove-c-1003.html) using the reTerminal!

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_Base_Hat_for_Raspberry_Pi/img/main.jpg" alt="pir" width="550" height="auto"></p>

The GPIO pins can draw a maximum current of **50mA safely**. This means 50mA distributed across all the pins. Therefore an individual GPIO pin can only safely draw **16mA** current. On the other hand, the maximum current draw for each of the remaning pins is **2A**. Please keep this in mind when you connect additional hardware to these pins.

### High-Speed Interface for Expansion Modules

There is a high-speed expansion interface at the back of the reTerminal. It consists of 1 PCIe 1-lane Host Gen 2 (supporting speeds up to 5Gbps), 1 USB 2.0, 1 PoE and 26 GPIOs. The 26 GPIO pins can be further used as 2 I2C, 2 SPI, 2 CAN-FD, 1 UART.

We plan to build expansion modules in the future for reTerminal and we have reserved this interface to connect these modules to the reTerminal. We will release a wide range of modules such as:

- Mic Array & Speaker Module
- Camera Module
- Industrial I/O
- LoraWAN Module
- 5G/4G Module 
- PoE Module 
- Ethernet Switch

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/ReTerminal/external_modules.png" alt="pir" width="750" height="auto"></p>

There are 2 x M4 mechanical screw holes on the side of the reTerminal to help keep the expansion modules in place.

### CSI Camera Interface

reTerminal has a 2-lane MIPI CSI camera interface, which means you can connect up to 2 cameras to the reTerminal. One interface has **15 pins** whereas the other interface has **22 pins**. So make sure to use the correct flex cable corresponding to the interface that you intend to use. These camera interfaces can be used for object detection and machine learning applications.

### FPC Interface

There is a **6-pin FPC** interface on the reTerminal. You can use this interface to connect additional hardware such as cameras and displays to the reTerminal.

### 5-Inch LCD

The inbuilt 5-inch LCD on the reTerminal is connected to the **DSI interface** on the carrier board inside. This LCD supports **5-point multi-touch** and in order to enable this feature, the LCD is connected to another **TP interface** on the carrier board.

### 4 User Programmable Buttons

There are 4 user programmable buttons at the front of the reTerminal. These buttons can be easily controlled using software and can be assigned to switch ON/OFF different functions according to your applications!

### 2 User Programmable LEDs

There are 2 user programmable LEDs at the front of the reTerminal. These LEDs can be switched ON/OFF using software and can be useful in scenarios where you want to use them as status LEDs to monitor different hardware features. The **USR** LED can be lighted up **Green**, wheras the **STA** LED can be lighted up either **Red** or **Green**

### Gigabit Ethernet Port

reTerminal has a Gigabit Ethernet Connector (RJ45) onboard. This port is connected to the **Gigabit Ethernet PHY** of the CM4 module which is based on **Broadcom BCM54210PE**. It is also **IEEE 1588-2008 compliant**. 

### Encryption Co-Processor

reTerminal has security features such as a **cryptographic co-processor** with secure hardware-based key storage. It also has protected storage for up to 16 keys, certificates, or data. It provides hardware support for symmetric sign, verify, key agreement – ECDSA. It has hardware support for symmetric algorithms, networking key management and secure boot. 

### RTC

The in-built RTC on the reTerminal is based on **NXP Semiconductors PCF8563T**. It has a low backup current; typical 0.25μA at VDD = 3.0 V and a temperature = 25°C. It can be used for projects where you need to implement time keeping functions.

### Light Sensor

reTerminal is quipped with a **Levelek LTR-303ALS-01** digital light sensor. It can be used to sense the light levels in the environment and also can be used for **automatic brightness adjustment of LCD backlight** according to the surrounding light levels.

### Accelerometer

The in-built **STMicroelectronics LIS3DHTR 3-axis accelerometer** can be used to realize many different applications with the reTerminal. You can use it to automatically change screen orientation as you rotate the reTerminal and much more.

### Buzzer

There is a built-in buzzer on the reTerminal. This can be controlled using software. This buzzer can be used as an indicator in different applications.

### USB 2.0 Ports

Raspberry Pi CM4 already has a **USB 2.0 Hub onboard**. This Hub is extended to **2 USB 2.0 Ports** on the reTerminal as **USB HOST**.

### Micro - SD Card Slot

reTerminal is equipped with a **micro-sd card slot**. This is useful when you want to **install the operating system** on to a micro-SD card, while the **CM4 module without eMMC** is used. However, when the eMMC version of the CM4 module is used, you can use a micro-SD card as additional storage.

### Micro HDMI Port

There is a micro HDMI port on the reTerminal and you can use it to connect to HDMI displays via a **micro HDMI to standard HDMI cable**.

### USB Type-C Port

The **USB Type-C Port** on the reTerminal can be used to **power the reTerminal using 5V/2A (recommended)**. However it can also be used to act as a **USB Device** where you can connect the reTerminal to a **HOST PC** and the reTerminal will act as a **USB Mass Storage Device**. In here, you will be able to access the **onboard eMMC** and the connected **micro-SD card** of the reTerminal via the PC.

### Standard Camera Mount (1/4 inch)

reTerminal has a **standard camera mount with a diameter 1/4 inch**. So you can connect the reTerminal to a **standard tripod**.
