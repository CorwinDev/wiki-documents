## Product Introduction
LoRa-E5 LoRaWAN module is designed with ST system-level package chip STM32WLE5JC, ARM Cortex M4 ultra-low-power MCU and LoRa SX126X. It supports (G)FSK mode and LoRa. 62.5kHz, 125kHz, 250kHz, and 500kHz bandwidth can be used in LoRa® mode, making it suitable for the design of various IoT nodes, supporting EU868 and US915.

LoRa-E5 is a low-cost, ultra-low power, extremely compact, and high-performance LoRaWAN Module designed by Seeed Technology Co., Ltd. **It contains ST system-level package chip STM32WLE5JE, which is the world first SoC integrated with the combo of LoRa RF and MCU chip.** This module is also embedded with ARM Cortex M4 ultra-low-power MCU and LoRa SX126X, and therefore supports (G)FSK mode and LoRa.

The previous versions of the LoRaWAN module all require an additional use of MCU (Microcontroller) to run the application code. Now, you can directly and immediately put the LoRa-E5 STM32WLE5JC Module into use to complete this process without the hustle of additional accessories. With the Stamp Hole form factor, LoRa-E5 enables you can to integrate this module on your device’s mainboard conveniently. You don’t need to waste time and effort on designing your own device from scratch with the use of MCU and LoRa chip. Moreover, the module has already been certificated, so your completed device can be certified and approved by any agency cheaply and rapidly. Thanks to the innovative design, LoRa-E5 has a comparatively lower cost than other LoRaWAN modules. This will greatly save your budgets in the whole process of product design.  

LoRa-E5 LoRaWAN® module is highly suitable for long-distance, ultra-low-power applications such as wireless meter reading, sensor networks, wireless communication, and other low-power wide-area IoT scenarios. If you want a module to design your own LoRaWAN sensor, to construct IoT nodes, or to support any wireless communication applications, LoRa-E5 is the premium choice that provides you with optimal user experience.
