| Category of Sensors        | Principles                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|GSR             | GSR sensors help us measure sweat gland activity related to emotional agitation. We use the electrical properties of the skin to measure GSR. In other words, the skin resistance changes with sweat gland activity, which is, sweat gland activity occurs, the more sweating, the smaller the skin resistance. |
| EMG                  | EMG detector is a bridge connects human body and electrical, the sensor gathers small muscle signal then process with 2th amplify and filter, the output signal can be recognized by Arduino. |
| Heart Rate              | The heart rate sensor uses optical technology to detect the amount of blood oxygen in the subcutaneous capillaries to detect the corresponding human heart rate, so that the module can easily and conveniently measure the heart rate. The heart rate sensor uses optical technology to detect the heart rate of the human body through changes in the amount of blood oxygen in the subcutaneous capillaries. Heart rate detection can be widely used in scenarios such as wearable devices and fitness auxiliary equipment.|
| Fingerprint                    | A fingerprint sensor is a sensing device, which belongs to an optical fingerprint sensor and a semiconductor fingerprint sensor, and is a key device for automatic fingerprint collection.


## Field of Applicaitons

There are a numerous use of these health-related sensors. Particularly, using these kinds of sensors, human beings can be monitored and saved from potential dangers. Hence the health sensors play important roles in various sectors, which include industry, medical, social applications, and domestic applications for monitoring body feature of people.
