Build a unified AI strategy around your brand and products with our speech recognition and [Natural-language understanding (NLU) technologies](https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/natural-language-understanding-NLU).

## New Wiki Added

### Connect Wio Terminal to Google Cloud IoT Core

[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) consists of a set of physical assets, such as computers and hard disk drives, and virtual resources, such as virtual machines (VMs), that are contained in Google's data centers around the globe. This distribution of resources provides several benefits, including redundancy in case of failure and reduced latency by locating resources closer to clients.

We have prepared a [tutorial](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Connect_Wio_Terminal_to_Google_Cloud_IoT_Core/) to walk you through the process of connecting the Wio Terminal to Google Cloud IoT Core and send telemetry data from the Wio Terminal to the Google Cloud IoT core.
