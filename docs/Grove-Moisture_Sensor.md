## Usage

Its pretty easy to build Grove circuits using the Grove modules in your Mixer Pack.

All circuits are built by combining the following four types of modules:

<dl><dt>1. Power Modules
</dt><dd> These supply power to the circuit. The [Grove Mixer Pack V2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Mixer-Pack-V2Electronic-blockswithout-Arduinoplug-and-play-system-p-1867.html?cPath=14) includes 1 Power Module - the [Grove - DC Jack Power](/Grove-DC_Jack_Power "Grove - DC Jack Power"). No matter what you are building, you will always need to use this one.

</dd><dt>2. Input Modules
</dt><dd> These are typically used to relay sensory inputs into the circuit. The [Grove Mixer Pack V2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Mixer-Pack-V2Electronic-blockswithout-Arduinoplug-and-play-system-p-1867.html?cPath=14) has 4 Input Modules - a light sensor, a sound sensor, a slide potentiometer and a momentary switch.

### Building your first circuit

You can build a Grove circuit using the Grove Modules in 3 simple steps:

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-concept-3.jpg)


**Follow these steps in order to build a Grove circuit using the Grove Modules:**

<dl><dt>STEP 1 - Connect the Power Module to a power source
</dt><dd> First of all, connect a reliable power source to the power module. You can use a 9V battery that connects to the [Grove - DC Jack Power](/Grove-DC_Jack_Power "Grove - DC Jack Power") module using the 9V battery connector cable that comes with the pack. Alternatively, you can use a common wall power adapter such as a 5V/1A adapter used for charging cell phones. Once you have connected the Grove power module to a power source, turn the ON/OFF switch on the module to ON position. A green LED on the board of the power module should light up. If this does not happen, double check your connections and power source. If the green LED lights up, this means you have a reliable working power source. Turn the switch back to OFF position now and proceed to the next step.

</dd><dt>STEP 2 - Connect the Input Module to the Power Module
</dt><dd> Using a 4-Pin Grove cable, connect the input module you wish to choose for your circuit to the power module. Place the power module in front of you and place the input module to the left of the power module. Then using a 4-Pin Grove Cable, plug one end of it into the input module and the other end into the left-side Grove connector of the power module. For example, to use a momentary switch to turn on and off an LED, connect the [Grove - Button](/Grove-Button "Grove - Button") module to the left-side of the power module using a 4-Pin Grove Cable.
The input module could either be directly connected to the power module or via a Logic Gate module.

</dd><dt>STEP 3 - Connect the Output Module to the Power Module
</dt><dd>Using a 4-Pin Grove cable, connect the output module you wish to choose for your circuit to the power module. Place the power module in front of you with the input module already connected to the left-side of the power module. Then using a 4-Pin Grove Cable, plug one end of it into the output module and the other end into the right-side Grove connector of the power module. For example, to build a circuit that lights up an LED, connect the [Grove - Red LED](/Grove-Red_LED "Grove - Red LED") module to the right-side of the power module using a Grove Cable.
Output module always connect directly to the power module in this way.

### Using Logic Gate Modules

The logic gate modules can be used to enhance the logic based on which an input module or a set of input modules can be used to trigger a desired output. They  are typically placed between the input module and the power module in a Grove circuit.

There are three types of Logic Gate Modules:

#### [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") module

This is the simplest of all logic gate modules and connects to one input module. It simply takes the signal generated by an input module and inverts it. A HIGH signal from an input module is converted to a LOW signal. A LOW signal from the input module is converted to a HIGH signal going towards the output module.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-LightSensorNOT-RedLED-ON.jpg)

Using [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") logic gate

Typical Usage:_ An [LDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor) based light sensor module like the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") generates a HIGH signal in bright light and a LOW signal in the dark. Therefore, it can be used to turn ON an LED in bright light and turn it OFF in the dark. However, you may want a circuit where the LED lights turn ON in the dark and remain OFF in bright light. This can be done by adding a [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") module between the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") input module and the [Grove - DC Jack Power](/Grove-DC_Jack_Power "Grove - DC Jack Power") module. With the NOT gate in use, you will observe that in bright light, when the LDR exhibits a low resistance and the signal generated by the light sensor module is HIGH, the NOT gate inverts it into a LOW signal and the LED lights **do not** turn ON in bright light any more. Alternatively, when it is dark and the LDR exhibits a high resistance and the signal generates by the light sensor module is LOW, the NOT gate converts the LOW signal into a HIGH signal resulting in the LED lights getting turned ON in the dark.

</dd></dl>

#### [Grove - OR](/Grove-OR "Grove - OR") module

This module can connect to two input modules. Its purpose is to generate a HIGH signal when at least one of the two input modules connected to it supplies a HIGH signal. If the signal received from both the input modules is LOW, the OR gate supplies a LOW signal towards the output module.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-or-usage.jpg)

Using [Grove - OR](/Grove-OR "Grove - OR") logic gate

Typical Usage:_ Use this when you need one of two sensory inputs to trigger an output. For example, lets say you want to build a circuit that lights up some LED lights either on music OR when you manually switch them on. To build such a circuit, you will need two input modules - the [Grove - Sound Sensor](/Grove-Sound_Sensor "Grove - Sound Sensor") and the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer"). These two input modules can then be connected to the left-side of the [Grove - OR](/Grove-OR "Grove - OR") gate module. The output from this logic gate module will connect to the left-side of the power module, while the right-side will be connected to the LED lights module ([Grove - Red LED](/Grove-Red_LED "Grove - Red LED") or [Grove - LED String Light](/Grove-LED_String_Light "Grove - LED String Light")). Now, when you switch ON the circuit, observe what happens. You will see that the LED lights turn ON either when there is some sound or music that is detected by the sound sensor OR when you manually move the slider on the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer") from minimum voltage (GND) to maximum (VCC). This also implies that if the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer") is supplying a HIGH signal to the LED lights, then no matter what the input from the sound sensor is, the LED lights will always stay ON. Alternatively, if the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer") is supplying a LOW signal to the LED lights, then the LED lights will flash based on whether the output from the sound sensor is HIGH or LOW.

</dd></dl>

#### [Grove - AND](/Grove-AND "Grove - AND") module

This module can connect to two input modules. Its purpose is to generate a HIGH signal only when both of the two input modules connected to it supply a HIGH signal. If the signal received from any of the two input modules is LOW, the AND gate supplies a LOW signal towards the output module.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-and-usage.jpg)

Using [Grove - AND](/Grove-AND "Grove - AND") logic gate

Typical Usage:_ Use this when you need two sensory inputs to trigger an output. For example, lets say you want to build a circuit that lights up some LED lights either on music but only in the dark. To build such a circuit, you will need two input modules - the [Grove - Sound Sensor](/Grove-Sound_Sensor "Grove - Sound Sensor") and the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") (The [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") module will be used in conjunction with the [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") logic gate so that lights switch ON only in the dark). These input side modules can then be connected to the left-side of the [Grove - AND](/Grove-AND "Grove - AND") gate module. The output from this logic gate module will connect to the left-side of the power module, while the right-side will be connected to the LED lights module ([Grove - Red LED](/Grove-Red_LED "Grove - Red LED") or [Grove - LED String Light](/Grove-LED_String_Light "Grove - LED String Light")). Now, when you switch ON the circuit, observe what happens. You will see that the LED lights turn ON when it is both dark AND there is some sound or music playing. This also implies that even if the [Grove - Sound Sensor](/Grove-Sound_Sensor "Grove - Sound Sensor") is supplying a HIGH signal to the LED lights when it detects sound or music, then unless the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") detects darkness, the LED lights will always stay OFF. Only when it is dark AND there is sound or music detected by the sound sensor will the LED lights will flash.

### Using Logic Gate Modules

The logic gate modules can be used to enhance the logic based on which an input module or a set of input modules can be used to trigger a desired output. They  are typically placed between the input module and the power module in a Grove circuit.

There are three types of Logic Gate Modules:

#### [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") module

This is the simplest of all logic gate modules and connects to one input module. It simply takes the signal generated by an input module and inverts it. A HIGH signal from an input module is converted to a LOW signal. A LOW signal from the input module is converted to a HIGH signal going towards the output module.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-LightSensorNOT-RedLED-ON.jpg)

Using [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") logic gate

Typical Usage:_ An [LDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor) based light sensor module like the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") generates a HIGH signal in bright light and a LOW signal in the dark. Therefore, it can be used to turn ON an LED in bright light and turn it OFF in the dark. However, you may want a circuit where the LED lights turn ON in the dark and remain OFF in bright light. This can be done by adding a [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") module between the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") input module and the [Grove - DC Jack Power](/Grove-DC_Jack_Power "Grove - DC Jack Power") module. With the NOT gate in use, you will observe that in bright light, when the LDR exhibits a low resistance and the signal generated by the light sensor module is HIGH, the NOT gate inverts it into a LOW signal and the LED lights **do not** turn ON in bright light any more. Alternatively, when it is dark and the LDR exhibits a high resistance and the signal generates by the light sensor module is LOW, the NOT gate converts the LOW signal into a HIGH signal resulting in the LED lights getting turned ON in the dark.

</dd></dl>

#### [Grove - OR](/Grove-OR "Grove - OR") module

This module can connect to two input modules. Its purpose is to generate a HIGH signal when at least one of the two input modules connected to it supplies a HIGH signal. If the signal received from both the input modules is LOW, the OR gate supplies a LOW signal towards the output module.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-or-usage.jpg)

Using [Grove - OR](/Grove-OR "Grove - OR") logic gate

Typical Usage:_ Use this when you need one of two sensory inputs to trigger an output. For example, lets say you want to build a circuit that lights up some LED lights either on music OR when you manually switch them on. To build such a circuit, you will need two input modules - the [Grove - Sound Sensor](/Grove-Sound_Sensor "Grove - Sound Sensor") and the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer"). These two input modules can then be connected to the left-side of the [Grove - OR](/Grove-OR "Grove - OR") gate module. The output from this logic gate module will connect to the left-side of the power module, while the right-side will be connected to the LED lights module ([Grove - Red LED](/Grove-Red_LED "Grove - Red LED") or [Grove - LED String Light](/Grove-LED_String_Light "Grove - LED String Light")). Now, when you switch ON the circuit, observe what happens. You will see that the LED lights turn ON either when there is some sound or music that is detected by the sound sensor OR when you manually move the slider on the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer") from minimum voltage (GND) to maximum (VCC). This also implies that if the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer") is supplying a HIGH signal to the LED lights, then no matter what the input from the sound sensor is, the LED lights will always stay ON. Alternatively, if the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer") is supplying a LOW signal to the LED lights, then the LED lights will flash based on whether the output from the sound sensor is HIGH or LOW.

</dd></dl>

#### [Grove - AND](/Grove-AND "Grove - AND") module

This module can connect to two input modules. Its purpose is to generate a HIGH signal only when both of the two input modules connected to it supply a HIGH signal. If the signal received from any of the two input modules is LOW, the AND gate supplies a LOW signal towards the output module.

Using [Grove - AND](/Grove-AND "Grove - AND") logic gate

Typical Usage:_ Use this when you need two sensory inputs to trigger an output. For example, lets say you want to build a circuit that lights up some LED lights either on music but only in the dark. To build such a circuit, you will need two input modules - the [Grove - Sound Sensor](/Grove-Sound_Sensor "Grove - Sound Sensor") and the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") (The [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") module will be used in conjunction with the [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") logic gate so that lights switch ON only in the dark). These input side modules can then be connected to the left-side of the [Grove - AND](/Grove-AND "Grove - AND") gate module. The output from this logic gate module will connect to the left-side of the power module, while the right-side will be connected to the LED lights module ([Grove - Red LED](/Grove-Red_LED "Grove - Red LED") or [Grove - LED String Light](/Grove-LED_String_Light "Grove - LED String Light")). Now, when you switch ON the circuit, observe what happens. You will see that the LED lights turn ON when it is both dark AND there is some sound or music playing. This also implies that even if the [Grove - Sound Sensor](/Grove-Sound_Sensor "Grove - Sound Sensor") is supplying a HIGH signal to the LED lights when it detects sound or music, then unless the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") detects darkness, the LED lights will always stay OFF. Only when it is dark AND there is sound or music detected by the sound sensor will the LED lights will flash.

## Usage

Its pretty easy to build Grove circuits using the Grove modules in your Mixer Pack.

All circuits are built by combining the following four types of modules:

<dl><dt>1. Power Modules
</dt><dd> These supply power to the circuit. The [Grove Mixer Pack V2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Mixer-Pack-V2Electronic-blockswithout-Arduinoplug-and-play-system-p-1867.html?cPath=14) includes 1 Power Module - the [Grove - DC Jack Power](/Grove-DC_Jack_Power "Grove - DC Jack Power"). No matter what you are building, you will always need to use this one.

</dd><dt>2. Input Modules
</dt><dd> These are typically used to relay sensory inputs into the circuit. The [Grove Mixer Pack V2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Mixer-Pack-V2Electronic-blockswithout-Arduinoplug-and-play-system-p-1867.html?cPath=14) has 4 Input Modules - a light sensor, a sound sensor, a slide potentiometer and a momentary switch.

### Building your first circuit

You can build a Grove circuit using the Grove Modules in 3 simple steps:

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-concept-3.jpg)


**Follow these steps in order to build a Grove circuit using the Grove Modules:**

<dl><dt>STEP 1 - Connect the Power Module to a power source
</dt><dd> First of all, connect a reliable power source to the power module. You can use a 9V battery that connects to the [Grove - DC Jack Power](/Grove-DC_Jack_Power "Grove - DC Jack Power") module using the 9V battery connector cable that comes with the pack. Alternatively, you can use a common wall power adapter such as a 5V/1A adapter used for charging cell phones. Once you have connected the Grove power module to a power source, turn the ON/OFF switch on the module to ON position. A green LED on the board of the power module should light up. If this does not happen, double check your connections and power source. If the green LED lights up, this means you have a reliable working power source. Turn the switch back to OFF position now and proceed to the next step.

</dd><dt>STEP 2 - Connect the Input Module to the Power Module
</dt><dd> Using a 4-Pin Grove cable, connect the input module you wish to choose for your circuit to the power module. Place the power module in front of you and place the input module to the left of the power module. Then using a 4-Pin Grove Cable, plug one end of it into the input module and the other end into the left-side Grove connector of the power module. For example, to use a momentary switch to turn on and off an LED, connect the [Grove - Button](/Grove-Button "Grove - Button") module to the left-side of the power module using a 4-Pin Grove Cable.
The input module could either be directly connected to the power module or via a Logic Gate module.

</dd><dt>STEP 3 - Connect the Output Module to the Power Module
</dt><dd>Using a 4-Pin Grove cable, connect the output module you wish to choose for your circuit to the power module. Place the power module in front of you with the input module already connected to the left-side of the power module. Then using a 4-Pin Grove Cable, plug one end of it into the output module and the other end into the right-side Grove connector of the power module. For example, to build a circuit that lights up an LED, connect the [Grove - Red LED](/Grove-Red_LED "Grove - Red LED") module to the right-side of the power module using a Grove Cable.
Output module always connect directly to the power module in this way.

### Using Logic Gate Modules

The logic gate modules can be used to enhance the logic based on which an input module or a set of input modules can be used to trigger a desired output. They  are typically placed between the input module and the power module in a Grove circuit.

There are three types of Logic Gate Modules:

#### [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") module

This is the simplest of all logic gate modules and connects to one input module. It simply takes the signal generated by an input module and inverts it. A HIGH signal from an input module is converted to a LOW signal. A LOW signal from the input module is converted to a HIGH signal going towards the output module.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-LightSensorNOT-RedLED-ON.jpg)

Using [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") logic gate

Typical Usage:_ An [LDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor) based light sensor module like the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") generates a HIGH signal in bright light and a LOW signal in the dark. Therefore, it can be used to turn ON an LED in bright light and turn it OFF in the dark. However, you may want a circuit where the LED lights turn ON in the dark and remain OFF in bright light. This can be done by adding a [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") module between the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") input module and the [Grove - DC Jack Power](/Grove-DC_Jack_Power "Grove - DC Jack Power") module. With the NOT gate in use, you will observe that in bright light, when the LDR exhibits a low resistance and the signal generated by the light sensor module is HIGH, the NOT gate inverts it into a LOW signal and the LED lights **do not** turn ON in bright light any more. Alternatively, when it is dark and the LDR exhibits a high resistance and the signal generates by the light sensor module is LOW, the NOT gate converts the LOW signal into a HIGH signal resulting in the LED lights getting turned ON in the dark.

</dd></dl>

#### [Grove - OR](/Grove-OR "Grove - OR") module

This module can connect to two input modules. Its purpose is to generate a HIGH signal when at least one of the two input modules connected to it supplies a HIGH signal. If the signal received from both the input modules is LOW, the OR gate supplies a LOW signal towards the output module.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-or-usage.jpg)

Using [Grove - OR](/Grove-OR "Grove - OR") logic gate

Typical Usage:_ Use this when you need one of two sensory inputs to trigger an output. For example, lets say you want to build a circuit that lights up some LED lights either on music OR when you manually switch them on. To build such a circuit, you will need two input modules - the [Grove - Sound Sensor](/Grove-Sound_Sensor "Grove - Sound Sensor") and the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer"). These two input modules can then be connected to the left-side of the [Grove - OR](/Grove-OR "Grove - OR") gate module. The output from this logic gate module will connect to the left-side of the power module, while the right-side will be connected to the LED lights module ([Grove - Red LED](/Grove-Red_LED "Grove - Red LED") or [Grove - LED String Light](/Grove-LED_String_Light "Grove - LED String Light")). Now, when you switch ON the circuit, observe what happens. You will see that the LED lights turn ON either when there is some sound or music that is detected by the sound sensor OR when you manually move the slider on the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer") from minimum voltage (GND) to maximum (VCC). This also implies that if the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer") is supplying a HIGH signal to the LED lights, then no matter what the input from the sound sensor is, the LED lights will always stay ON. Alternatively, if the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer") is supplying a LOW signal to the LED lights, then the LED lights will flash based on whether the output from the sound sensor is HIGH or LOW.

</dd></dl>

#### [Grove - AND](/Grove-AND "Grove - AND") module

This module can connect to two input modules. Its purpose is to generate a HIGH signal only when both of the two input modules connected to it supply a HIGH signal. If the signal received from any of the two input modules is LOW, the AND gate supplies a LOW signal towards the output module.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-and-usage.jpg)

Using [Grove - AND](/Grove-AND "Grove - AND") logic gate

Typical Usage:_ Use this when you need two sensory inputs to trigger an output. For example, lets say you want to build a circuit that lights up some LED lights either on music but only in the dark. To build such a circuit, you will need two input modules - the [Grove - Sound Sensor](/Grove-Sound_Sensor "Grove - Sound Sensor") and the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") (The [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") module will be used in conjunction with the [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") logic gate so that lights switch ON only in the dark). These input side modules can then be connected to the left-side of the [Grove - AND](/Grove-AND "Grove - AND") gate module. The output from this logic gate module will connect to the left-side of the power module, while the right-side will be connected to the LED lights module ([Grove - Red LED](/Grove-Red_LED "Grove - Red LED") or [Grove - LED String Light](/Grove-LED_String_Light "Grove - LED String Light")). Now, when you switch ON the circuit, observe what happens. You will see that the LED lights turn ON when it is both dark AND there is some sound or music playing. This also implies that even if the [Grove - Sound Sensor](/Grove-Sound_Sensor "Grove - Sound Sensor") is supplying a HIGH signal to the LED lights when it detects sound or music, then unless the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") detects darkness, the LED lights will always stay OFF. Only when it is dark AND there is sound or music detected by the sound sensor will the LED lights will flash.

### Using Logic Gate Modules

The logic gate modules can be used to enhance the logic based on which an input module or a set of input modules can be used to trigger a desired output. They  are typically placed between the input module and the power module in a Grove circuit.

There are three types of Logic Gate Modules:

#### [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") module

This is the simplest of all logic gate modules and connects to one input module. It simply takes the signal generated by an input module and inverts it. A HIGH signal from an input module is converted to a LOW signal. A LOW signal from the input module is converted to a HIGH signal going towards the output module.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-LightSensorNOT-RedLED-ON.jpg)

Using [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") logic gate

Typical Usage:_ An [LDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor) based light sensor module like the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") generates a HIGH signal in bright light and a LOW signal in the dark. Therefore, it can be used to turn ON an LED in bright light and turn it OFF in the dark. However, you may want a circuit where the LED lights turn ON in the dark and remain OFF in bright light. This can be done by adding a [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") module between the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") input module and the [Grove - DC Jack Power](/Grove-DC_Jack_Power "Grove - DC Jack Power") module. With the NOT gate in use, you will observe that in bright light, when the LDR exhibits a low resistance and the signal generated by the light sensor module is HIGH, the NOT gate inverts it into a LOW signal and the LED lights **do not** turn ON in bright light any more. Alternatively, when it is dark and the LDR exhibits a high resistance and the signal generates by the light sensor module is LOW, the NOT gate converts the LOW signal into a HIGH signal resulting in the LED lights getting turned ON in the dark.

</dd></dl>

#### [Grove - OR](/Grove-OR "Grove - OR") module

This module can connect to two input modules. Its purpose is to generate a HIGH signal when at least one of the two input modules connected to it supplies a HIGH signal. If the signal received from both the input modules is LOW, the OR gate supplies a LOW signal towards the output module.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-or-usage.jpg)

Using [Grove - OR](/Grove-OR "Grove - OR") logic gate

Typical Usage:_ Use this when you need one of two sensory inputs to trigger an output. For example, lets say you want to build a circuit that lights up some LED lights either on music OR when you manually switch them on. To build such a circuit, you will need two input modules - the [Grove - Sound Sensor](/Grove-Sound_Sensor "Grove - Sound Sensor") and the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer"). These two input modules can then be connected to the left-side of the [Grove - OR](/Grove-OR "Grove - OR") gate module. The output from this logic gate module will connect to the left-side of the power module, while the right-side will be connected to the LED lights module ([Grove - Red LED](/Grove-Red_LED "Grove - Red LED") or [Grove - LED String Light](/Grove-LED_String_Light "Grove - LED String Light")). Now, when you switch ON the circuit, observe what happens. You will see that the LED lights turn ON either when there is some sound or music that is detected by the sound sensor OR when you manually move the slider on the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer") from minimum voltage (GND) to maximum (VCC). This also implies that if the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer") is supplying a HIGH signal to the LED lights, then no matter what the input from the sound sensor is, the LED lights will always stay ON. Alternatively, if the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer") is supplying a LOW signal to the LED lights, then the LED lights will flash based on whether the output from the sound sensor is HIGH or LOW.

</dd></dl>

#### [Grove - AND](/Grove-AND "Grove - AND") module

This module can connect to two input modules. Its purpose is to generate a HIGH signal only when both of the two input modules connected to it supply a HIGH signal. If the signal received from any of the two input modules is LOW, the AND gate supplies a LOW signal towards the output module.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-and-usage.jpg)

Using [Grove - AND](/Grove-AND "Grove - AND") logic gate

Typical Usage:_ Use this when you need two sensory inputs to trigger an output. For example, lets say you want to build a circuit that lights up some LED lights either on music but only in the dark. To build such a circuit, you will need two input modules - the [Grove - Sound Sensor](/Grove-Sound_Sensor "Grove - Sound Sensor") and the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") (The [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") module will be used in conjunction with the [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") logic gate so that lights switch ON only in the dark). These input side modules can then be connected to the left-side of the [Grove - AND](/Grove-AND "Grove - AND") gate module. The output from this logic gate module will connect to the left-side of the power module, while the right-side will be connected to the LED lights module ([Grove - Red LED](/Grove-Red_LED "Grove - Red LED") or [Grove - LED String Light](/Grove-LED_String_Light "Grove - LED String Light")). Now, when you switch ON the circuit, observe what happens. You will see that the LED lights turn ON when it is both dark AND there is some sound or music playing. This also implies that even if the [Grove - Sound Sensor](/Grove-Sound_Sensor "Grove - Sound Sensor") is supplying a HIGH signal to the LED lights when it detects sound or music, then unless the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") detects darkness, the LED lights will always stay OFF. Only when it is dark AND there is sound or music detected by the sound sensor will the LED lights will flash.

## Usage

Its pretty easy to build Grove circuits using the Grove modules in your Mixer Pack.

All circuits are built by combining the following four types of modules:

<dl><dt>1. Power Modules
</dt><dd> These supply power to the circuit. The [Grove Mixer Pack V2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Mixer-Pack-V2Electronic-blockswithout-Arduinoplug-and-play-system-p-1867.html?cPath=14) includes 1 Power Module - the [Grove - DC Jack Power](/Grove-DC_Jack_Power "Grove - DC Jack Power"). No matter what you are building, you will always need to use this one.

</dd><dt>2. Input Modules
</dt><dd> These are typically used to relay sensory inputs into the circuit. The [Grove Mixer Pack V2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Mixer-Pack-V2Electronic-blockswithout-Arduinoplug-and-play-system-p-1867.html?cPath=14) has 4 Input Modules - a light sensor, a sound sensor, a slide potentiometer and a momentary switch. Based on the inputs received from these modules from these modules, you can choose to trigger an action using an Output Module.

### Building your first circuit

You can build a Grove circuit using the Grove Modules in 3 simple steps:

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-concept-3.jpg)


**Follow these steps in order to build a Grove circuit using the Grove Modules:**

<dl><dt>STEP 1 - Connect the Power Module to a power source
</dt><dd> First of all, connect a reliable power source to the power module. You can use a 9V battery that connects to the [Grove - DC Jack Power](/Grove-DC_Jack_Power "Grove - DC Jack Power") module using the 9V battery connector cable that comes with the pack. Alternatively, you can use a common wall power adapter such as a 5V/1A adapter used for charging cell phones. Once you have connected the Grove power module to a power source, turn the ON/OFF switch on the module to ON position. A green LED on the board of the power module should light up. If this does not happen, double check your connections and power source. If the green LED lights up, this means you have a reliable working power source. Turn the switch back to OFF position now and proceed to the next step.

</dd><dt>STEP 2 - Connect the Input Module to the Power Module
</dt><dd> Using a 4-Pin Grove cable, connect the input module you wish to choose for your circuit to the power module. Place the power module in front of you and place the input module to the left of the power module. Then using a 4-Pin Grove Cable, plug one end of it into the input module and the other end into the left-side Grove connector of the power module. For example, to use a momentary switch to turn on and off an LED, connect the [Grove - Button](/Grove-Button "Grove - Button") module to the left-side of the power module using a 4-Pin Grove Cable.
The input module could either be directly connected to the power module or via a Logic Gate module.

</dd><dt>STEP 3 - Connect the Output Module to the Power Module
</dt><dd>Using a 4-Pin Grove cable, connect the output module you wish to choose for your circuit to the power module. Place the power module in front of you with the input module already connected to the left-side of the power module. Then using a 4-Pin Grove Cable, plug one end of it into the output module and the other end into the right-side Grove connector of the power module. For example, to build a circuit that lights up an LED, connect the [Grove - Red LED](/Grove-Red_LED "Grove - Red LED") module to the right-side of the power module using a Grove Cable.
Output module always connect directly to the power module in this way.

### Using Logic Gate Modules

The logic gate modules can be used to enhance the logic based on which an input module or a set of input modules can be used to trigger a desired output. They  are typically placed between the input module and the power module in a Grove circuit.

There are three types of Logic Gate Modules:

#### [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") module

This is the simplest of all logic gate modules and connects to one input module. It simply takes the signal generated by an input module and inverts it. A HIGH signal from an input module is converted to a LOW signal. A LOW signal from the input module is converted to a HIGH signal going towards the output module.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-LightSensorNOT-RedLED-ON.jpg)

Using [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") logic gate

Typical Usage:_ An [LDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor) based light sensor module like the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") generates a HIGH signal in bright light and a LOW signal in the dark. Therefore, it can be used to turn ON an LED in bright light and turn it OFF in the dark. However, you may want a circuit where the LED lights turn ON in the dark and remain OFF in bright light. This can be done by adding a [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") module between the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") input module and the [Grove - DC Jack Power](/Grove-DC_Jack_Power "Grove - DC Jack Power") module. With the NOT gate in use, you will observe that in bright light, when the LDR exhibits a low resistance and the signal generated by the light sensor module is HIGH, the NOT gate inverts it into a LOW signal and the LED lights **do not** turn ON in bright light any more. Alternatively, when it is dark and the LDR exhibits a high resistance and the signal generates by the light sensor module is LOW, the NOT gate converts the LOW signal into a HIGH signal resulting in the LED lights getting turned ON in the dark.

</dd></dl>

#### [Grove - OR](/Grove-OR "Grove - OR") module

This module can connect to two input modules. Its purpose is to generate a HIGH signal when at least one of the two input modules connected to it supplies a HIGH signal. If the signal received from both the input modules is LOW, the OR gate supplies a LOW signal towards the output module.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-or-usage.jpg)

Using [Grove - OR](/Grove-OR "Grove - OR") logic gate

Typical Usage:_ Use this when you need one of two sensory inputs to trigger an output. For example, lets say you want to build a circuit that lights up some LED lights either on music OR when you manually switch them on. To build such a circuit, you will need two input modules - the [Grove - Sound Sensor](/Grove-Sound_Sensor "Grove - Sound Sensor") and the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer"). These two input modules can then be connected to the left-side of the [Grove - OR](/Grove-OR "Grove - OR") gate module. The output from this logic gate module will connect to the left-side of the power module, while the right-side will be connected to the LED lights module ([Grove - Red LED](/Grove-Red_LED "Grove - Red LED") or [Grove - LED String Light](/Grove-LED_String_Light "Grove - LED String Light")). Now, when you switch ON the circuit, observe what happens. You will see that the LED lights turn ON either when there is some sound or music that is detected by the sound sensor OR when you manually move the slider on the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer") from minimum voltage (GND) to maximum (VCC). This also implies that if the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer") is supplying a HIGH signal to the LED lights, then no matter what the input from the sound sensor is, the LED lights will always stay ON. Alternatively, if the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer") is supplying a LOW signal to the LED lights, then the LED lights will flash based on whether the output from the sound sensor is HIGH or LOW.

</dd></dl>

#### [Grove - AND](/Grove-AND "Grove - AND") module

This module can connect to two input modules. Its purpose is to generate a HIGH signal only when both of the two input modules connected to it supply a HIGH signal. If the signal received from any of the two input modules is LOW, the AND gate supplies a LOW signal towards the output module.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-and-usage.jpg)

Using [Grove - AND](/Grove-AND "Grove - AND") logic gate

Typical Usage:_ Use this when you need two sensory inputs to trigger an output. For example, lets say you want to build a circuit that lights up some LED lights either on music but only in the dark. To build such a circuit, you will need two input modules - the [Grove - Sound Sensor](/Grove-Sound_Sensor "Grove - Sound Sensor") and the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") (The [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") module will be used in conjunction with the [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") logic gate so that lights switch ON only in the dark). These input side modules can then be connected to the left-side of the [Grove - AND](/Grove-AND "Grove - AND") gate module. The output from this logic gate module will connect to the left-side of the power module, while the right-side will be connected to the LED lights module ([Grove - Red LED](/Grove-Red_LED "Grove - Red LED") or [Grove - LED String Light](/Grove-LED_String_Light "Grove - LED String Light")). Now, when you switch ON the circuit, observe what happens. You will see that the LED lights turn ON when it is both dark AND there is some sound or music playing. This also implies that even if the [Grove - Sound Sensor](/Grove-Sound_Sensor "Grove - Sound Sensor") is supplying a HIGH signal to the LED lights when it detects sound or music, then unless the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") detects darkness, the LED lights will always stay OFF. Only when it is dark AND there is sound or music detected by the sound sensor will the LED lights will flash.

</dt><dd> These supply power to the circuit. The [Grove Mixer Pack V2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Mixer-Pack-V2Electronic-blockswithout-Arduinoplug-and-play-system-p-1867.html?cPath=14) includes 1 Power Module - the [Grove - DC Jack Power](/Grove-DC_Jack_Power "Grove - DC Jack Power"). No matter what you are building, you will always need to use this one.

</dd><dt>2. Input Modules
</dt><dd> These are typically used to relay sensory inputs into the circuit. The [Grove Mixer Pack V2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Mixer-Pack-V2Electronic-blockswithout-Arduinoplug-and-play-system-p-1867.html?cPath=14) has 4 Input Modules - a light sensor, a sound sensor, a slide potentiometer and a momentary switch. Based on the inputs received from these modules from these modules, you can choose to trigger an action using an Output Module.

</dd><dt>3. Output Modules
</dt><dd> Triggers from the Input Modules can be translated to actions using Output Modules. The [Grove Mixer Pack V2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Mixer-Pack-V2Electronic-blockswithout-Arduinoplug-and-play-system-p-1867.html?cPath=14) has 5 Output Modules - an LED light, an LED String light, a sound recorder, a fan motor and a buzzer.

</dd><dt>4. Logic Gates Modules
</dt><dd> These are used in conjunction with Input Modules and can be used to enhance the logic for triggering a specific output. The [Grove Mixer Pack V2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Mixer-Pack-V2Electronic-blockswithout-Arduinoplug-and-play-system-p-1867.html?cPath=14) has 3 Logic Gates Modules - one each for AND, OR and NOT gate functions.

### Building your first circuit

You can build a Grove circuit using the Grove Modules in 3 simple steps:

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-concept-3.jpg)


**Follow these steps in order to build a Grove circuit using the Grove Modules:**

<dl><dt>STEP 1 - Connect the Power Module to a power source
</dt><dd> First of all, connect a reliable power source to the power module. You can use a 9V battery that connects to the [Grove - DC Jack Power](/Grove-DC_Jack_Power "Grove - DC Jack Power") module using the 9V battery connector cable that comes with the pack. Alternatively, you can use a common wall power adapter such as a 5V/1A adapter used for charging cell phones. Once you have connected the Grove power module to a power source, turn the ON/OFF switch on the module to ON position. A green LED on the board of the power module should light up. If this does not happen, double check your connections and power source. If the green LED lights up, this means you have a reliable working power source. Turn the switch back to OFF position now and proceed to the next step.

</dd><dt>STEP 2 - Connect the Input Module to the Power Module
</dt><dd> Using a 4-Pin Grove cable, connect the input module you wish to choose for your circuit to the power module. Place the power module in front of you and place the input module to the left of the power module. Then using a 4-Pin Grove Cable, plug one end of it into the input module and the other end into the left-side Grove connector of the power module. For example, to use a momentary switch to turn on and off an LED, connect the [Grove - Button](/Grove-Button "Grove - Button") module to the left-side of the power module using a 4-Pin Grove Cable.
The input module could either be directly connected to the power module or via a Logic Gate module.

</dd><dt>STEP 3 - Connect the Output Module to the Power Module
</dt><dd>Using a 4-Pin Grove cable, connect the output module you wish to choose for your circuit to the power module. Place the power module in front of you with the input module already connected to the left-side of the power module. Then using a 4-Pin Grove Cable, plug one end of it into the output module and the other end into the right-side Grove connector of the power module. For example, to build a circuit that lights up an LED, connect the [Grove - Red LED](/Grove-Red_LED "Grove - Red LED") module to the right-side of the power module using a Grove Cable.
Output module always connect directly to the power module in this way.

Press on the momentary switch to light up the LED


### Using Logic Gate Modules

The logic gate modules can be used to enhance the logic based on which an input module or a set of input modules can be used to trigger a desired output. They  are typically placed between the input module and the power module in a Grove circuit.

There are three types of Logic Gate Modules:

#### [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") module

This is the simplest of all logic gate modules and connects to one input module. It simply takes the signal generated by an input module and inverts it. A HIGH signal from an input module is converted to a LOW signal. A LOW signal from the input module is converted to a HIGH signal going towards the output module.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-LightSensorNOT-RedLED-ON.jpg)

Using [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") logic gate

Typical Usage:_ An [LDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor) based light sensor module like the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") generates a HIGH signal in bright light and a LOW signal in the dark. Therefore, it can be used to turn ON an LED in bright light and turn it OFF in the dark. However, you may want a circuit where the LED lights turn ON in the dark and remain OFF in bright light. This can be done by adding a [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") module between the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") input module and the [Grove - DC Jack Power](/Grove-DC_Jack_Power "Grove - DC Jack Power") module. With the NOT gate in use, you will observe that in bright light, when the LDR exhibits a low resistance and the signal generated by the light sensor module is HIGH, the NOT gate inverts it into a LOW signal and the LED lights **do not** turn ON in bright light any more. Alternatively, when it is dark and the LDR exhibits a high resistance and the signal generates by the light sensor module is LOW, the NOT gate converts the LOW signal into a HIGH signal resulting in the LED lights getting turned ON in the dark.

</dd></dl>

#### [Grove - OR](/Grove-OR "Grove - OR") module

This module can connect to two input modules. Its purpose is to generate a HIGH signal when at least one of the two input modules connected to it supplies a HIGH signal. If the signal received from both the input modules is LOW, the OR gate supplies a LOW signal towards the output module.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-or-usage.jpg)

Using [Grove - OR](/Grove-OR "Grove - OR") logic gate

Typical Usage:_ Use this when you need one of two sensory inputs to trigger an output. For example, lets say you want to build a circuit that lights up some LED lights either on music OR when you manually switch them on. To build such a circuit, you will need two input modules - the [Grove - Sound Sensor](/Grove-Sound_Sensor "Grove - Sound Sensor") and the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer"). These two input modules can then be connected to the left-side of the [Grove - OR](/Grove-OR "Grove - OR") gate module. The output from this logic gate module will connect to the left-side of the power module, while the right-side will be connected to the LED lights module ([Grove - Red LED](/Grove-Red_LED "Grove - Red LED") or [Grove - LED String Light](/Grove-LED_String_Light "Grove - LED String Light")). Now, when you switch ON the circuit, observe what happens. You will see that the LED lights turn ON either when there is some sound or music that is detected by the sound sensor OR when you manually move the slider on the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer") from minimum voltage (GND) to maximum (VCC). This also implies that if the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer") is supplying a HIGH signal to the LED lights, then no matter what the input from the sound sensor is, the LED lights will always stay ON. Alternatively, if the [Grove - Slide Potentiometer](/Grove-Slide_Potentiometer "Grove - Slide Potentiometer") is supplying a LOW signal to the LED lights, then the LED lights will flash based on whether the output from the sound sensor is HIGH or LOW.

</dd></dl>

#### [Grove - AND](/Grove-AND "Grove - AND") module

This module can connect to two input modules. Its purpose is to generate a HIGH signal only when both of the two input modules connected to it supply a HIGH signal. If the signal received from any of the two input modules is LOW, the AND gate supplies a LOW signal towards the output module.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Mixer_Pack_V2/img/Grove-and-usage.jpg)

Using [Grove - AND](/Grove-AND "Grove - AND") logic gate

Typical Usage:_ Use this when you need two sensory inputs to trigger an output. For example, lets say you want to build a circuit that lights up some LED lights either on music but only in the dark. To build such a circuit, you will need two input modules - the [Grove - Sound Sensor](/Grove-Sound_Sensor "Grove - Sound Sensor") and the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") (The [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") module will be used in conjunction with the [Grove - NOT](/Grove-NOT "Grove - NOT") logic gate so that lights switch ON only in the dark). These input side modules can then be connected to the left-side of the [Grove - AND](/Grove-AND "Grove - AND") gate module. The output from this logic gate module will connect to the left-side of the power module, while the right-side will be connected to the LED lights module ([Grove - Red LED](/Grove-Red_LED "Grove - Red LED") or [Grove - LED String Light](/Grove-LED_String_Light "Grove - LED String Light")). Now, when you switch ON the circuit, observe what happens. You will see that the LED lights turn ON when it is both dark AND there is some sound or music playing. This also implies that even if the [Grove - Sound Sensor](/Grove-Sound_Sensor "Grove - Sound Sensor") is supplying a HIGH signal to the LED lights when it detects sound or music, then unless the [Grove - Light Sensor](/Grove-Light_Sensor "Grove - Light Sensor") detects darkness, the LED lights will always stay OFF. Only when it is dark AND there is sound or music detected by the sound sensor will the LED lights will flash.

```c
/*
  Moisture-Sensor
  The following sketch demonstrates a simple application of sensing
  the moisture of the soil. You can know whether a plant needs water
  or not by observing the results that the sensor outputs.
  The circuit:
    * Moisture-Sensor attached to pin 24 (J6 plug on Grove Base BoosterPack)
    * one side pin (either one) to ground
    * the other side pin to +VCC
    * LED anode (long leg) attached to RED_LED
    * LED cathode (short leg) attached to ground
  - NOTE:
    This example code is in the public domain.

## FAQs

**Q1: What does the output mean? voltage or counts?**

A1: The output is voltage values. When using analogRead(), 5V will be divided by 1023. So the output value = Vout * 1023/5. The higher output voltage is, the higher moisture there is.
