![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/IMAGE/July%20Week%204/July-Week-4-logo.png)

Hello everyone! We hope everyone is staying safe from COVID-19 and wishing you all good health!
It's the fourth week of July and we are back with "Seeed Weekly Wiki Updates" as promised. This week was also filled with a lot of fun stuff at Seeed and we are happy to update you all with what we have done at Seeed Wiki. 
As you all know, Seeed Wiki is a dedicated platform where we provide the proper guidance and support you need when getting started with our products. We put a lot of effort to make this platform more user friendly because we want to enable the learning of electronics in a more systematic approach.  
We will bring you all these wiki updates in a weekly basis. So stay tuned with us and don't forget to visit this page again next week!

## Existing Wiki Updated

### 1. Ardupy Support For Grove - CO2 & Temperature & Humidity Sensor (SCD30)

Wih the introduction of ArduPy along with the [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html), we work hard to gradually bring you it's support to all the Grove Modules in the Grove Ecosystem. 
So in this week, we have added ArduPy support for our [Grove - CO2 & Temperature & Humidity Sensor (SCD30)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-CO2-Temperature-Humidity-Sensor-SCD30-p-2911.html) and prepared a [tutorial](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-CO2_Temperature_Humidity_Sensor-SCD30/) for you to get started with [ArduPy](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ArduPy/) using our Grove - CO2 & Temperature & Humidity Sensor and Wio Terminal quickly and easily.

### 2. Ardupy Support For Grove - Barometer Sensor(BME280)
 
We have also added ArduPy support for our [Grove - Barometer Sensor(BME280)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-BME280-Environmental-Sensor-Temperature-Humidity-Barometer.html) and prepared a [getting started guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Barometer_Sensor-BME280/) for you to get started with ArduPy using our Grove - Barometer Sensor(BME280) and Wio Terminal quickly and easily.

## New Wiki Added

### 1. Wio Terminal Edge Impulse Getting Started

Edge Impulse enables developers to create the next generation of intelligent device solutions with embedded Machine Learning. Machine Learning at the very edge will enable valuable use of the 99% of sensor data that is discarded today due to cost, bandwidth or power constraints.

Now, Wio Terminal is officially supported by Edge Impulse and we have prepared a [step-by-step guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Edge-Impulse/) for Wio Terminal to get started with Machine learning at the edge!

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Edge-Impulse/"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Wio-Terminal-Edge-Impulse/banner.png" alt="pir"  width="900" height="auto"></a></p>

### 2. Wio Terminal Continuous Motion Recognition

When you want to run a gesture recognition system, it's not very efficient to run using rule based programming because people don't perform gestures in the exact same way every time.But machine learning can handle these variations with ease.
So we have prepared a [tutorial](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Continuous-Motion-Recognition/) explaining about applying machine learning using Edge Impulse to build a gesture recognition system that runs on Wio Terminal. 

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Continuous-Motion-Recognition/"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Wio-Terminal-Edge-Impulse/test.png" alt="pir"  width="900" height="auto"></a></p>


### 3. Using Wio Terminal with Edge Impulse to Distinguish Alcohol

We have also prepared another demo using Edge Impulse on the Wio Terminal! In this demo Edge Impulse is used on the Wio Terminal to distinguish different alcohols. We have prepared a [wiki page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Edge-Impulse-Distinguish-Alochol/) to get started with this demo.

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Edge-Impulse-Distinguish-Alochol/"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Wio-Terminal-Edge-Impulse/booze.jpg" alt="pir"  width="900" height="auto"></a></p>

### 4. How to Write an ArduPy Library

Won't it be cool if you could convert your favorite Arduino library into MicroPython form factor and use it with ArduPy! We have prepared a [wiki page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ArduPy-Libraries/) explaining about how to write an ArduPy library from scratch and used an example to fully walk through the workflow!

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ArduPy-Libraries/"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/ardupy/ardupy_logo.png" alt="pir"  width="900" height="auto"></a></p>
