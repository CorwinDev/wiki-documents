### Grove - OLED Display 0.66" (SSD1306)

As a new version, the [Grove - OLED Display 0.66" (SSD1306)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-OLED-Display-0-66-SSD1306-v1-0-p-5096.html) has a smaller screen compared to the other OLED display like Grove - OLED Display 0.96" (SSD1315). And yet it can still display with 64×48 resolution and it preserve the performance like the others, e.g. high brightness, low power consumption and Grove interface on the back, etc.

### STM32 Flashing Guide for reTerminal LCD

It is very important to make sure that you have the latest firmware flashed on to the STM32G030 chip on the reTerminal. STM32G030 is responsible to drive the LCD on the reTerminal.
