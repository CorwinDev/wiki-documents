We put a lot of effort to make this platform more user friendly because we want to enable the learning of electronics in a more systematic approach.  
We will bring you all these wiki updates in a weekly basis. So stay tuned with us and don't forget to visit this page again next week!

## Existing Wiki Updated

### Ardupy Support for Grove - Temperature & Humidity Sensor (DHT11)

We constantly bring you more and more Ardupy support for our Grove modules so that you can use them with Ardupy on the [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html). This time we have bring you Ardupy support for the [Grove - Temperature & Humidity Sensor](DHT11https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Temperature-Humidity-Sensor-DHT11.html). Now you can use MicroPython along with ArduPy on the Wio Terminal and use the Grove - Temperature & Humidity Sensor (DHT11) in your projects.

## New Wiki Added 

### Flashing the Arduino Bootloader using DAP Link

 Is your Arduino Board's bootloader interrupted? Worry no more. Now you can use DAP link (OpenOCD) to re-flash the bootloader back into your Arduino board. We have prepared a [step-by-step guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Flashing-Arduino-Bootloader-DAPLink/) to walk you through the process!

### Using Web Bluetooth APIs with Wio Terminal

Now you can use the Bluetooth functionality on the Wio Terminal to interact with web browsers. We have prepared a couple of demos to demonstrate this feature. First, the Wio Terminal is setup and a simple HTML site is used to interact with the Web Bluetooth API. Then the Wio Terminal is connected with a simple website and the onboard accelerometer data is visualized on the website.
