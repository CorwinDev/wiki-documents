[NFC Shield](https://seeeddoc.github.io/NFC_Shield/)  is a **Near Field Communication** interface for  **Arduino**  build around the popular  NXP PN532  integrated circuit.  NFC  is a short-distance radio technology that enables communication between devices that are held close together.**NFC** traces its roots in  **RFID**  technology and is an open platform technology standardized in ECMA-340 and ISO/IEC 18092.

NFC is widely used like RFID to recognize cards/tags (NXP Mifare Cards / Tags). NFC can be used as an alternative to **travel card** using the read/write memory provided by cards/tags. Few mobile phones comes with NFC inbuilt - they are used as readers of cards, tags, smart posters with a Web URL(like a Mobile QR-Code reader). This technology is also being applied for **smart cashless purchases**.

Like many other standards, NFC technology is regulated by  **Near Field Communication Forum**  which standardizes  **NFC**  communication -- how they devices pair, share data and allow a secure transaction to happen.[NFC Forum](http://www.nfc-forum.org) develops and certifies devices compliant with **NFC standards**.

NFC operate on unlicensed ISM(Industry Scientific Medical) band of **13.56 MHz** Frequency. NFC communication range is up to 10 cm. But, this is limited by the antenna and power radiation design. Most devices work within a range of 10mm. [NFC Shield](https://seeeddoc.github.io/NFC_Shield/)  antenna is designed to work within a range of 1cm. [NFC Shield](https://seeeddoc.github.io/NFC_Shield/)  provides all necessary circuitry for **PN532** like 27.12Mhz crystal, power supply.It also beaks-out the I/O pins of **PN532** for easy access.

The communication between Arduino and [NFC Shield](https://seeeddoc.github.io/NFC_Shield/)  is via SPI.

Model: [SLD80453P](https://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/nfc-shield-p-916.html?cPath=132_134)


##   Features   ##

-  Arduino Shield compatible. No soldering required.

- **SPI** interface. Hence, most **Arduino** pins are available for other applications.

-  Built in **PCB Antenna**.

-  Supports both 3.3V and 5V operation using TI's **TXB0104** level translator.

-  Socket to connect other shields.

-  The maximum communication range of this NFC Shield is about 5 cm

-  Not being able to read/write ultralightC chip,Only to Read its ID

##   Application Ideas   ##

- Use as a RFID reader with **Mifare One tags** (ISO14443 Type-A) and cards (13.56Mhz).

- Build visiting card sharing system.

- Build attendance systems.

- Design authentication systems.

- Read Smart Posters.

- Securely exchange small data with other NFC devices

- Use with [Seeeduino ADK Main Board](https://seeeddoc.github.io/Seeeduino_ADK_Main_Board/)  for creating mobile NFC applications.

- And other endless possibility.

##   Usage   ##

###   Hardware Installation   ###

- Set **Seeeduino** power selection slide-switch to 3.3V.

- Connect [NFC Shield](https://seeeddoc.github.io/NFC_Shield/)  to **Seeeduino** as shown below.

- Compile and upload the example sketch provided.

[NFC Shield](https://seeeddoc.github.io/NFC_Shield/)  is a **Near Field Communication** interface for  **Arduino**  build around the popular  NXP PN532  integrated circuit.  NFC  is a short-distance radio technology that enables communication between devices that are held close together.**NFC** traces its roots in  **RFID**  technology and is an open platform technology standardized in ECMA-340 and ISO/IEC 18092.

NFC is widely used like RFID to recognize cards/tags (NXP Mifare Cards / Tags). NFC can be used as an alternative to **travel card** using the read/write memory provided by cards/tags. Few mobile phones comes with NFC inbuilt - they are used as readers of cards, tags, smart posters with a Web URL(like a Mobile QR-Code reader). This technology is also being applied for **smart cashless purchases**.

Like many other standards, NFC technology is regulated by  **Near Field Communication Forum**  which standardizes  **NFC**  communication -- how they devices pair, share data and allow a secure transaction to happen.[NFC Forum](http://www.nfc-forum.org) develops and certifies devices compliant with **NFC standards**.

NFC operate on unlicensed ISM(Industry Scientific Medical) band of **13.56 MHz** Frequency. NFC communication range is up to 10 cm. But, this is limited by the antenna and power radiation design. Most devices work within a range of 10mm. [NFC Shield](https://seeeddoc.github.io/NFC_Shield/)  antenna is designed to work within a range of 1cm. [NFC Shield](https://seeeddoc.github.io/NFC_Shield/)  provides all necessary circuitry for **PN532** like 27.12Mhz crystal, power supply.It also beaks-out the I/O pins of **PN532** for easy access.

The communication between Arduino and [NFC Shield](https://seeeddoc.github.io/NFC_Shield/)  is via SPI.

Model: [SLD80453P](https://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/nfc-shield-p-916.html?cPath=132_134)


##   Features   ##

-  Arduino Shield compatible. No soldering required.

- **SPI** interface. Hence, most **Arduino** pins are available for other applications.

-  Built in **PCB Antenna**.

-  Supports both 3.3V and 5V operation using TI's **TXB0104** level translator.

-  Socket to connect other shields.

-  The maximum communication range of this NFC Shield is about 5 cm

-  Not being able to read/write ultralightC chip,Only to Read its ID

##   Application Ideas   ##

- Use as a RFID reader with **Mifare One tags** (ISO14443 Type-A) and cards (13.56Mhz).

- Build visiting card sharing system.

- Build attendance systems.

- Design authentication systems.

- Read Smart Posters.

- Securely exchange small data with other NFC devices

- Use with [Seeeduino ADK Main Board](https://seeeddoc.github.io/Seeeduino_ADK_Main_Board/)  for creating mobile NFC applications.

- And other endless possibility.

##   Usage   ##

###   Hardware Installation   ###

**This sketch reads the complete memory of a MIFARE Standard card using default authentication keys. The output gives typical memory layout of fresh MIFARE Standard card.**

2.Bring a Mifare Card near the NFC Antenna. Open the serial monitor, you can see the score as show below:
