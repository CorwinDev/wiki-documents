## New Wiki Added

### Getting Started with reTerminal

Introducing [reTerminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/ReTerminal-with-CM4-p-4904.html), a new member of our reThings family. This future-ready Human-Machine Interface (HMI) device can easily and efficiently work with IoT and cloud systems to unlock endless scenarios at the edge.

reTerminal is powered by a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4) which is a Quad-Core Cortex-A72 CPU running at 1.5GHz and a 5-inch IPS capacitive multi-touch screen with a resolution of 1280 x 720. It has sufficient amount of RAM (4GB) to perform multitasking and also has sufficient amount of eMMC storage (32GB) to install an operating system, enabling fast boot up times and smooth overall experience. It has wireless connectivity with dual-band 2.4GHz/5GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0 BLE.

So far we have prepared four wiki documents for reTerminal and more will be cominmg along the way!
