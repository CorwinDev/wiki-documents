## New Wiki Added

### 1. Microwave Sensor - 24GHz Doppler Radar Motion Sensor - MW2401TR11 

MW2401TR11 is a 24GHz human motion microwave sensor module with a highly intelligent algorithm, equipped with a high-performance transceiver. The antenna not only has good directivity, but can also adjust the coverage area through software settings according to different application scenarios, and filter out interference through smart algorithms. Also it is able to effectively identify the subtle movement of objects. 
We have prepared a [wiki page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Microwave_Sensor-24GHz_Doppler_Radar_Motion_Sensor-MW2401TR11/) for you to quickly get started with this doppler radar motion sensor!

### 2. Using the Built-in RTC on the Wio Terminal 

The SAMD51 core which is located within the Wio Terminal has a built-in RTC functionality so that you can keep track of time, year, month, and date information eventhough the power to the Wio Terminal gets cut off! This feature saves you from adding an external RTC module to the system!
We have prepared a [wiki page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-RTC/) to introduce this functionality!
