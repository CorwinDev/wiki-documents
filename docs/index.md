# Weekly Wiki
![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/IMAGES/21-October-Week-3.png)

It's the third week of Ocotober and we are back with "Seeed Weekly Wiki Updates" as promised. This week was also filled with a lot of fun stuff at Seeed and we are happy to update you all with what we have done at Seeed Wiki. 
As you all know, Seeed Wiki is a dedicated platform where we provide the proper guidance and support you need when getting started with our products. We put a lot of effort to make this platform more user friendly because we want to enable the learning of electronics in a more systematic approach.  
We will bring you all these wiki updates in a weekly basis. So stay tuned with us and don't forget to visit this page again next week!

## New Wiki Added

### Grove - Formaldehyde Sensor

Grove Formaldehyde Sensor can detect formaldehyde around 0~1000 ppb with low cross-sensitivity to alcohol and high stability of 6 years lifetime. Built-in RHT sensor ensures it maintains fine performance under different temperatures and humidity and it transmits data through UART and I2C ports.

We have prepared a [step-by-step guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Formaldehyde-Sensor) to get started with this sensor!

### LoRa Node with AIoTs GPS & State Tester

The AIoTs GPS & state tester is basic on Wio Terminal Chassis-LoRa-E5 and GNSS to develop. It compares with the traditional IoTs has more conciseness and intelligence. The traditional one basically just receives some data then does a command action regardless of the data whether is correct. And yet the AIoTs using neural network algorithm is able to filter the useless data to get the correct ones.

### Face Recognition Demo on reTerminal with TensorFlow Lite

TensorFlow Lite is a set of tools that enables on-device machine learning by helping developers run their models on mobile, embedded, and IoT devices. The key features of TensorFlow Lite are optimized for on-device machine learning, with a focus on latency, privacy, connectivity, size, and power consumption. 

It is possible to use TFLite Converter to convert any Tensorflow model into .tflite format, provided it only consists of operations supported by TFLite Runtime. We have newly added the face recognition demo [here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reTerminal_ML_TFLite/#examples)!
